/* __vtv_verify_fail is the function that gets called if the vtable
  verification code discovers a vtable pointer that it cannot verify
  as valid.  Normally __vtv_verify_fail calls __vtv_really_fail.
  However programmers can write and link in their own version of
  __vtv_verify_fail, if they wish to do some kind of secondary
  verification, for example.  The main verification code assumes that
  IF __vtv_verify_fail returns, then some kind of secondary
  verification was done AND that the secondary verification succeeded,
  i.e. that the vtable pointer is actually valid and ok to use.  If
  the secondary verification fails, then __vtv_verify_fail should not
  return.  */

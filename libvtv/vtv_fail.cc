/* This file is part of the vtable security feature implementation.
   The vtable security feature is designed to detect when a virtual
   call is about to be made through an invalid vtable pointer
   (possibly due to data corruption or malicious attacks).

   This file also contains the failure functions that get called when
   a vtable pointer is not found in the data set.  Two particularly
   important functions are __vtv_verify_fail and __vtv_really_fail.
   They are both externally visible.  __vtv_verify_fail is defined in
   such a way that it can be replaced by a programmer, if desired.  It
   is the function that __VLTVerifyVtablePointer calls if it can't
   find the pointer in the data set.  Allowing the programmer to
   overwrite this function means that he/she can do some alternate
   verification, including NOT failing in certain specific cases, if
   desired.  This may be the case if the programmer has to deal wtih
   unverified third party software, for example.  __vtv_really_fail is
   available for the programmer to call from his version of
   __vtv_verify_fail, if he decides the failure is real.

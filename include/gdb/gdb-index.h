/* Each symbol in .gdb_index refers to a set of CUs that defines the symbol.
   Each CU is represented by a 32 bit number that is the index of the CU in
   the CU table, plus some attributes of the use of the symbol in that CU.

   The values are defined such that if all the bits are zero, then no
   special meaning is assigned to any of them.  This is done to preserve
   compatibility with older indices.  The way this is done is to specify
   that if the GDB_INDEX_SYMBOL_KIND value is zero then all other attribute
   bits must be zero.

    0-23  CU index
   24-27  reserved
   28-30  symbol kind
   31     0 == global, 1 == static

   Bits 24-27 are reserved because it's easier to relax restrictions than
   it is to impose them after the fact.  At present 24 bits to represent
   the CU index is plenty.  If we need more bits for the CU index or for
   attributes then we have them.  */

// This datastructure is the blocking, mutex-based side of the Dekker-style
// reader-writer lock used to provide mutual exclusion between active and
// serial transactions. It has similarities to POSIX pthread_rwlock_t except
// that we also provide for upgrading a reader->writer lock, with a
// positive indication of failure (another writer acquired the lock
// before we were able to acquire). While the writer flag (a_writer below) is
// global and protected by the mutex, there are per-transaction reader flags,
// which are stored in a transaction's shared state.
// See libitm's documentation for further details.
//
// In this implementation, writers are given highest priority access but
// read-to-write upgrades do not have a higher priority than writers.
//
// Do not change the layout of this class; it must remain a POD type with
// standard layout, and the summary field must be first (i.e., so the
// assembler code can assume that its address is equal to the address of the
// respective instance of the class), and htm_fastpath must be second.

  Declarations are automatically created by the compiler.  All
  declarations start with "__builtin_". Refer to _builtins.def in the
  GCC source for a list of functions.  Not all of the functions are
  supported.

  In addition to built-in functions, the following types are defined.

  $(TABLE

  $(TR $(TD ___builtin_clong  )      $(TD The D equivalent of the target's

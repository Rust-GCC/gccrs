/// A memory allocator that can be registered as the standard libraryâ€™s default
/// through the `#[global_allocator]` attribute.
///
/// Some of the methods require that a memory block be *currently
/// allocated* via an allocator. This means that:
///
/// * the starting address for that memory block was previously
///   returned by a previous call to an allocation method
///   such as `alloc`, and
///
/// * the memory block has not been subsequently deallocated, where
///   blocks are deallocated either by being passed to a deallocation
///   method such as `dealloc` or by being
///   passed to a reallocation method that returns a non-null pointer.
///
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::alloc::{GlobalAlloc, Layout, alloc};
/// use std::ptr::null_mut;
///
/// struct MyAllocator;
///
/// unsafe impl GlobalAlloc for MyAllocator {
///     unsafe fn alloc(&self, _layout: Layout) -> *mut u8 { null_mut() }
///     unsafe fn dealloc(&self, _ptr: *mut u8, _layout: Layout) {}
/// }
///
/// #[global_allocator]
/// static A: MyAllocator = MyAllocator;
///
/// fn main() {
///     unsafe {
///         assert!(alloc(Layout::new::<u32>()).is_null())
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The `GlobalAlloc` trait is an `unsafe` trait for a number of reasons, and
/// implementors must ensure that they adhere to these contracts:
///
/// * It's undefined behavior if global allocators unwind. This restriction may
///   be lifted in the future, but currently a panic from any of these
///   functions may lead to memory unsafety.
///
/// * `Layout` queries and calculations in general must be correct. Callers of
///   this trait are allowed to rely on the contracts defined on each method,
///   and implementors must ensure such contracts remain true.

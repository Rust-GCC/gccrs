/// Compares and exchange 16 bytes (128 bits) of data atomically.
///
/// This intrinsic corresponds to the `cmpxchg16b` instruction on `x86_64`
/// processors. It performs an atomic compare-and-swap, updating the `ptr`
/// memory location to `val` if the current value in memory equals `old`.
///
/// # Return value
///
/// This function returns the previous value at the memory location. If it is
/// equal to `old` then the memory was updated to `new`.
///
/// # Memory Orderings
///
/// This atomic operations has the same semantics of memory orderings as
/// `AtomicUsize::compare_exchange` does, only operating on 16 bytes of memory
/// instead of just a pointer.
///
/// For more information on memory orderings here see the `compare_exchange`
/// documentation for other `Atomic*` types in the standard library.
///
/// # Unsafety
///
/// This method is unsafe because it takes a raw pointer and will attempt to
/// read and possibly write the memory at the pointer. The pointer must also be
/// aligned on a 16-byte boundary.
///
/// This method also requires the `cmpxchg16b` CPU feature to be available at
/// runtime to work correctly. If the CPU running the binary does not actually
/// support `cmpxchg16b` and the program enters an execution path that
/// eventually would reach this function the behavior is undefined.
///
/// The `success` ordering must also be stronger or equal to `failure`, or this
/// function call is undefined. See the `Atomic*` documentation's
/// `compare_exchange` function for more information. When `compare_exchange`
/// panics, this is undefined behavior. Currently this function aborts the
/// process with an undefined instruction.

//! Panic support for libcore
//!
//! The core library cannot define panicking, but it does *declare* panicking. This
//! means that the functions inside of libcore are allowed to panic, but to be
//! useful an upstream crate must define panicking for libcore to use. The current
//! interface for panicking is:
//!
//! ```
//! fn panic_impl(pi: &core::panic::PanicInfo<'_>) -> !
//! # { loop {} }
//! ```
//!
//! This definition allows for panicking with any general message, but it does not
//! allow for failing with a `Box<Any>` value. (`PanicInfo` just contains a `&(dyn Any + Send)`,
//! for which we fill in a dummy value in `PanicInfo::internal_constructor`.)
//! The reason for this is that libcore is not allowed to allocate.
//!
//! This module contains a few other panicking functions, but these are just the
//! necessary lang items for the compiler. All panics are funneled through this
//! one function. The actual symbol is declared through the `#[panic_handler]` attribute.

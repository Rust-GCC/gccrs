//! Converting decimal strings into IEEE 754 binary floating point numbers.
//!
//! # Problem statement
//!
//! We are given a decimal string such as `12.34e56`. This string consists of integral (`12`),
//! fractional (`45`), and exponent (`56`) parts. All parts are optional and interpreted as zero
//! when missing.
//!
//! We seek the IEEE 754 floating point number that is closest to the exact value of the decimal
//! string. It is well-known that many decimal strings do not have terminating representations in
//! base two, so we round to 0.5 units in the last place (in other words, as well as possible).
//! Ties, decimal values exactly half-way between two consecutive floats, are resolved with the
//! half-to-even strategy, also known as banker's rounding.
//!
//! Needless to say, this is quite hard, both in terms of implementation complexity and in terms
//! of CPU cycles taken.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! First, we ignore signs. Or rather, we remove it at the very beginning of the conversion
//! process and re-apply it at the very end. This is correct in all edge cases since IEEE
//! floats are symmetric around zero, negating one simply flips the first bit.
//!
//! Then we remove the decimal point by adjusting the exponent: Conceptually, `12.34e56` turns
//! into `1234e54`, which we describe with a positive integer `f = 1234` and an integer `e = 54`.
//! The `(f, e)` representation is used by almost all code past the parsing stage.
//!
//! We then try a long chain of progressively more general and expensive special cases using
//! machine-sized integers and small, fixed-sized floating point numbers (first `f32`/`f64`, then
//! a type with 64 bit significand, `Fp`). When all these fail, we bite the bullet and resort to a
//! simple but very slow algorithm that involved computing `f * 10^e` fully and doing an iterative
//! search for the best approximation.
//!
//! Primarily, this module and its children implement the algorithms described in:
//! "How to Read Floating Point Numbers Accurately" by William D. Clinger,
//! available online: <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.45.4152>
//!
//! In addition, there are numerous helper functions that are used in the paper but not available
//! in Rust (or at least in core). Our version is additionally complicated by the need to handle
//! overflow and underflow and the desire to handle subnormal numbers. Bellerophon and
//! Algorithm R have trouble with overflow, subnormals, and underflow. We conservatively switch to
//! Algorithm M (with the modifications described in section 8 of the paper) well before the
//! inputs get into the critical region.
//!
//! Another aspect that needs attention is the ``RawFloat`` trait by which almost all functions
//! are parametrized. One might think that it's enough to parse to `f64` and cast the result to
//! `f32`. Unfortunately this is not the world we live in, and this has nothing to do with using
//! base two or half-to-even rounding.
//!
//! Consider for example two types `d2` and `d4` representing a decimal type with two decimal
//! digits and four decimal digits each and take "0.01499" as input. Let's use half-up rounding.
//! Going directly to two decimal digits gives `0.01`, but if we round to four digits first,
//! we get `0.0150`, which is then rounded up to `0.02`. The same principle applies to other
//! operations as well, if you want 0.5 ULP accuracy you need to do *everything* in full precision
//! and round *exactly once, at the end*, by considering all truncated bits at once.
//!
//! FIXME: Although some code duplication is necessary, perhaps parts of the code could be shuffled
//! around such that less code is duplicated. Large parts of the algorithms are independent of the
//! float type to output, or only needs access to a few constants, which could be passed in as
//! parameters.
//!
//! # Other
//!
//! The conversion should *never* panic. There are assertions and explicit panics in the code,
//! but they should never be triggered and only serve as internal sanity checks. Any panics should
//! be considered a bug.
//!
//! There are unit tests but they are woefully inadequate at ensuring correctness, they only cover
//! a small percentage of possible errors. Far more extensive tests are located in the directory
//! `src/etc/test-float-parse` as a Python script.
//!
//! A note on integer overflow: Many parts of this file perform arithmetic with the decimal
//! exponent `e`. Primarily, we shift the decimal point around: Before the first decimal digit,
//! after the last decimal digit, and so on. This could overflow if done carelessly. We rely on
//! the parsing submodule to only hand out sufficiently small exponents, where "sufficient" means
//! "such that the exponent +/- the number of decimal digits fits into a 64 bit integer".
//! Larger exponents are accepted, but we don't do arithmetic with them, they are immediately
//! turned into {positive,negative} {zero,infinity}.

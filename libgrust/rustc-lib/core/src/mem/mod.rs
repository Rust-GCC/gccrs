/// Takes ownership and "forgets" about the value **without running its destructor**.
///
/// Any resources the value manages, such as heap memory or a file handle, will linger
/// forever in an unreachable state. However, it does not guarantee that pointers
/// to this memory will remain valid.
///
/// * If you want to leak memory, see [`Box::leak`].
/// * If you want to obtain a raw pointer to the memory, see [`Box::into_raw`].
/// * If you want to dispose of a value properly, running its destructor, see
/// [`mem::drop`].
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `forget` is not marked as `unsafe`, because Rust's safety guarantees
/// do not include a guarantee that destructors will always run. For example,
/// a program can create a reference cycle using [`Rc`][rc], or call
/// [`process::exit`][exit] to exit without running destructors. Thus, allowing
/// `mem::forget` from safe code does not fundamentally change Rust's safety
/// guarantees.
///
/// That said, leaking resources such as memory or I/O objects is usually undesirable.
/// The need comes up in some specialized use cases for FFI or unsafe code, but even
/// then, [`ManuallyDrop`] is typically preferred.
///
/// Because forgetting a value is allowed, any `unsafe` code you write must
/// allow for this possibility. You cannot return a value and expect that the
/// caller will necessarily run the value's destructor.
///
/// [rc]: ../../std/rc/struct.Rc.html
/// [exit]: ../../std/process/fn.exit.html
///
/// # Examples
///
/// The canonical safe use of `mem::forget` is to circumvent a value's destructor
/// implemented by the `Drop` trait. For example, this will leak a `File`, i.e. reclaim
/// the space taken by the variable but never close the underlying system resource:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use std::mem;
/// use std::fs::File;
///
/// let file = File::open("foo.txt").unwrap();
/// mem::forget(file);
/// ```
///
/// This is useful when the ownership of the underlying resource was previously
/// transferred to code outside of Rust, for example by transmitting the raw
/// file descriptor to C code.
///
/// # Relationship with `ManuallyDrop`
///
/// While `mem::forget` can also be used to transfer *memory* ownership, doing so is error-prone.
/// [`ManuallyDrop`] should be used instead. Consider, for example, this code:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
///
/// let mut v = vec![65, 122];
/// // Build a `String` using the contents of `v`
/// let s = unsafe { String::from_raw_parts(v.as_mut_ptr(), v.len(), v.capacity()) };
/// // leak `v` because its memory is now managed by `s`
/// mem::forget(v);  // ERROR - v is invalid and must not be passed to a function
/// assert_eq!(s, "Az");
/// // `s` is implicitly dropped and its memory deallocated.
/// ```
///
/// There are two issues with the above example:
///
/// * If more code were added between the construction of `String` and the invocation of
///   `mem::forget()`, a panic within it would cause a double free because the same memory
///   is handled by both `v` and `s`.
/// * After calling `v.as_mut_ptr()` and transmitting the ownership of the data to `s`,
///   the `v` value is invalid. Even when a value is just moved to `mem::forget` (which won't
///   inspect it), some types have strict requirements on their values that
///   make them invalid when dangling or no longer owned. Using invalid values in any
///   way, including passing them to or returning them from functions, constitutes
///   undefined behavior and may break the assumptions made by the compiler.
///
/// Switching to `ManuallyDrop` avoids both issues:
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem::ManuallyDrop;
///
/// let v = vec![65, 122];
/// // Before we disassemble `v` into its raw parts, make sure it
/// // does not get dropped!
/// let mut v = ManuallyDrop::new(v);
/// // Now disassemble `v`. These operations cannot panic, so there cannot be a leak.
/// let (ptr, len, cap) = (v.as_mut_ptr(), v.len(), v.capacity());
/// // Finally, build a `String`.
/// let s = unsafe { String::from_raw_parts(ptr, len, cap) };
/// assert_eq!(s, "Az");
/// // `s` is implicitly dropped and its memory deallocated.
/// ```
///
/// `ManuallyDrop` robustly prevents double-free because we disable `v`'s destructor
/// before doing anything else. `mem::forget()` doesn't allow this because it consumes its
/// argument, forcing us to call it only after extracting anything we need from `v`. Even
/// if a panic were introduced between construction of `ManuallyDrop` and building the
/// string (which cannot happen in the code as shown), it would result in a leak and not a
/// double free. In other words, `ManuallyDrop` errs on the side of leaking instead of
/// erring on the side of (double-)dropping.
///
/// Also, `ManuallyDrop` prevents us from having to "touch" `v` after transferring the
/// ownership to `s` â€” the final step of interacting with `v` to dispose of it without
/// running its destructor is entirely avoided.

/// More specifically, this is the offset in bytes between successive elements
/// in an array with that item type including alignment padding. Thus, for any
/// type `T` and length `n`, `[T; n]` has a size of `n * size_of::<T>()`.
///
/// In general, the size of a type is not stable across compilations, but
/// specific types such as primitives are.
///
/// The following table gives the size for primitives.
///
/// Type | size_of::\<Type>()
/// ---- | ---------------
/// () | 0
/// bool | 1
/// u8 | 1
/// u16 | 2
/// u32 | 4

/// char | 4
///
/// Furthermore, `usize` and `isize` have the same size.
///
/// The types `*const T`, `&T`, `Box<T>`, `Option<&T>`, and `Option<Box<T>>` all have
/// the same size. If `T` is Sized, all of those types have the same size as `usize`.
///
/// The mutability of a pointer does not change its size. As such, `&T` and `&mut T`
/// have the same size. Likewise for `*const T` and `*mut T`.
///
/// # Size of `#[repr(C)]` items
///
/// The `C` representation for items has a defined layout. With this layout,
/// the size of items is also stable as long as all fields have a stable size.
///
/// ## Size of Structs
///
/// For `structs`, the size is determined by the following algorithm.
///
/// For each field in the struct ordered by declaration order:
///
/// 1. Add the size of the field.
/// 2. Round up the current size to the nearest multiple of the next field's [alignment].
///
/// Finally, round the size of the struct to the nearest multiple of its [alignment].
/// The alignment of the struct is usually the largest alignment of all its
/// fields; this can be changed with the use of `repr(align(N))`.
///
/// Unlike `C`, zero sized structs are not rounded up to one byte in size.
///
/// ## Size of Enums
///
/// Enums that carry no data other than the discriminant have the same size as C enums
/// on the platform they are compiled for.
///
/// ## Size of Unions
///
/// The size of a union is the size of its largest field.
///
/// Unlike `C`, zero sized unions are not rounded up to one byte in size.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::mem;
///
/// // Some primitives
/// assert_eq!(4, mem::size_of::<i32>());
/// assert_eq!(8, mem::size_of::<f64>());
/// assert_eq!(0, mem::size_of::<()>());
///
/// // Some arrays
/// assert_eq!(8, mem::size_of::<[i32; 2]>());
/// assert_eq!(12, mem::size_of::<[i32; 3]>());
/// assert_eq!(0, mem::size_of::<[i32; 0]>());
///
///
/// // Pointer size equality
/// assert_eq!(mem::size_of::<&i32>(), mem::size_of::<*const i32>());

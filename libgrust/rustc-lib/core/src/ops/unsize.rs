use crate::marker::Unsize;

/// Trait that indicates that this is a pointer or a wrapper for one,
/// where unsizing can be performed on the pointee.
///
/// See the [DST coercion RFC][dst-coerce] and [the nomicon entry on coercion][nomicon-coerce]
/// for more details.
///
/// For builtin pointer types, pointers to `T` will coerce to pointers to `U` if `T: Unsize<U>`
/// by converting from a thin pointer to a fat pointer.
///
/// For custom types, the coercion here works by coercing `Foo<T>` to `Foo<U>`
/// provided an impl of `CoerceUnsized<Foo<U>> for Foo<T>` exists.
/// Such an impl can only be written if `Foo<T>` has only a single non-phantomdata
/// field involving `T`. If the type of that field is `Bar<T>`, an implementation
/// of `CoerceUnsized<Bar<U>> for Bar<T>` must exist. The coercion will work by
/// coercing the `Bar<T>` field into `Bar<U>` and filling in the rest of the fields
/// from `Foo<T>` to create a `Foo<U>`. This will effectively drill down to a pointer
/// field and coerce that.
///
/// Generally, for smart pointers you will implement
/// `CoerceUnsized<Ptr<U>> for Ptr<T> where T: Unsize<U>, U: ?Sized`, with an
/// optional `?Sized` bound on `T` itself. For wrapper types that directly embed `T`
/// like `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>`, you
/// can directly implement `CoerceUnsized<Wrap<U>> for Wrap<T> where T: CoerceUnsized<U>`.
/// This will let coercions of types like `Cell<Box<T>>` work.
///
/// [`Unsize`][unsize] is used to mark types which can be coerced to DSTs if behind
/// pointers. It is implemented automatically by the compiler.

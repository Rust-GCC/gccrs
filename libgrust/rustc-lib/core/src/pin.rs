//! Types that pin data to its location in memory.
//!
//! It is sometimes useful to have objects that are guaranteed not to move,
//! in the sense that their placement in memory does not change, and can thus be relied upon.
//! A prime example of such a scenario would be building self-referential structs,
//! as moving an object with pointers to itself will invalidate them, which could cause undefined
//! behavior.
//!
//! At a high level, a [`Pin<P>`] ensures that the pointee of any pointer type
//! `P` has a stable location in memory, meaning it cannot be moved elsewhere
//! and its memory cannot be deallocated until it gets dropped. We say that the
//! pointee is "pinned". Things get more subtle when discussing types that
//! combine pinned with non-pinned data; [see below](#projections-and-structural-pinning)
//! for more details.
//!
//! By default, all types in Rust are movable. Rust allows passing all types by-value,
//! and common smart-pointer types such as [`Box<T>`] and `&mut T` allow replacing and
//! moving the values they contain: you can move out of a [`Box<T>`], or you can use [`mem::swap`].
//! [`Pin<P>`] wraps a pointer type `P`, so [`Pin`]`<`[`Box`]`<T>>` functions much like a regular
//! [`Box<T>`]: when a [`Pin`]`<`[`Box`]`<T>>` gets dropped, so do its contents, and the memory gets
//! deallocated. Similarly, [`Pin`]`<&mut T>` is a lot like `&mut T`. However, [`Pin<P>`] does
//! not let clients actually obtain a [`Box<T>`] or `&mut T` to pinned data, which implies that you
//! cannot use operations such as [`mem::swap`]:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::pin::Pin;
//! fn swap_pins<T>(x: Pin<&mut T>, y: Pin<&mut T>) {
//!     // `mem::swap` needs `&mut T`, but we cannot get it.
//!     // We are stuck, we cannot swap the contents of these references.
//!     // We could use `Pin::get_unchecked_mut`, but that is unsafe for a reason:
//!     // we are not allowed to use it for moving things out of the `Pin`.
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! It is worth reiterating that [`Pin<P>`] does *not* change the fact that a Rust compiler
//! considers all types movable. [`mem::swap`] remains callable for any `T`. Instead, [`Pin<P>`]
//! prevents certain *values* (pointed to by pointers wrapped in [`Pin<P>`]) from being
//! moved by making it impossible to call methods that require `&mut T` on them
//! (like [`mem::swap`]).
//!
//! [`Pin<P>`] can be used to wrap any pointer type `P`, and as such it interacts with
//! [`Deref`] and [`DerefMut`]. A [`Pin<P>`] where `P: Deref` should be considered
//! as a "`P`-style pointer" to a pinned `P::Target` -- so, a [`Pin`]`<`[`Box`]`<T>>` is
//! an owned pointer to a pinned `T`, and a [`Pin`]`<`[`Rc`]`<T>>` is a reference-counted
//! pointer to a pinned `T`.
//! For correctness, [`Pin<P>`] relies on the implementations of [`Deref`] and
//! [`DerefMut`] not to move out of their `self` parameter, and only ever to
//! return a pointer to pinned data when they are called on a pinned pointer.
//!
//! # `Unpin`
//!
//! Many types are always freely movable, even when pinned, because they do not
//! rely on having a stable address. This includes all the basic types (like
//! [`bool`], [`i32`], and references) as well as types consisting solely of these
//! types. Types that do not care about pinning implement the [`Unpin`]
//! auto-trait, which cancels the effect of [`Pin<P>`]. For `T: Unpin`,
//! [`Pin`]`<`[`Box`]`<T>>` and [`Box<T>`] function identically, as do [`Pin`]`<&mut T>` and
//! `&mut T`.
//!
//! Note that pinning and [`Unpin`] only affect the pointed-to type `P::Target`, not the pointer
//! type `P` itself that got wrapped in [`Pin<P>`]. For example, whether or not [`Box<T>`] is
//! [`Unpin`] has no effect on the behavior of [`Pin`]`<`[`Box`]`<T>>` (here, `T` is the
//! pointed-to type).
//!
//! # Example: self-referential struct
//!
//! Before we go into more details to explain the guarantees and choices
//! associated with `Pin<T>`, we discuss some examples for how it might be used.
//! Feel free to [skip to where the theoretical discussion continues](#drop-guarantee).
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::pin::Pin;
//! use std::marker::PhantomPinned;
//! use std::ptr::NonNull;
//!
//! // This is a self-referential struct because the slice field points to the data field.
//! // We cannot inform the compiler about that with a normal reference,
//! // as this pattern cannot be described with the usual borrowing rules.
//! // Instead we use a raw pointer, though one which is known not to be null,
//! // as we know it's pointing at the string.
//! struct Unmovable {
//!     data: String,
//!     slice: NonNull<String>,
//!     _pin: PhantomPinned,
//! }
//!
//! impl Unmovable {
//!     // To ensure the data doesn't move when the function returns,
//!     // we place it in the heap where it will stay for the lifetime of the object,
//!     // and the only way to access it would be through a pointer to it.
//!     fn new(data: String) -> Pin<Box<Self>> {
//!         let res = Unmovable {
//!             data,
//!             // we only create the pointer once the data is in place
//!             // otherwise it will have already moved before we even started
//!             slice: NonNull::dangling(),
//!             _pin: PhantomPinned,
//!         };
//!         let mut boxed = Box::pin(res);
//!
//!         let slice = NonNull::from(&boxed.data);
//!         // we know this is safe because modifying a field doesn't move the whole struct
//!         unsafe {
//!             let mut_ref: Pin<&mut Self> = Pin::as_mut(&mut boxed);
//!             Pin::get_unchecked_mut(mut_ref).slice = slice;
//!         }
//!         boxed
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let unmoved = Unmovable::new("hello".to_string());
//! // The pointer should point to the correct location,
//! // so long as the struct hasn't moved.
//! // Meanwhile, we are free to move the pointer around.
//! # #[allow(unused_mut)]
//! let mut still_unmoved = unmoved;
//! assert_eq!(still_unmoved.slice, NonNull::from(&still_unmoved.data));
//!
//! // Since our type doesn't implement Unpin, this will fail to compile:
//! // let mut new_unmoved = Unmovable::new("world".to_string());
//! // std::mem::swap(&mut *still_unmoved, &mut *new_unmoved);
//! ```
//!
//! # Example: intrusive doubly-linked list
//!
//! In an intrusive doubly-linked list, the collection does not actually allocate
//! the memory for the elements itself. Allocation is controlled by the clients,
//! and elements can live on a stack frame that lives shorter than the collection does.
//!
//! To make this work, every element has pointers to its predecessor and successor in
//! the list. Elements can only be added when they are pinned, because moving the elements
//! around would invalidate the pointers. Moreover, the [`Drop`] implementation of a linked
//! list element will patch the pointers of its predecessor and successor to remove itself
//! from the list.
//!
//! Crucially, we have to be able to rely on [`drop`] being called. If an element
//! could be deallocated or otherwise invalidated without calling [`drop`], the pointers into it
//! from its neighboring elements would become invalid, which would break the data structure.
//!
//! Therefore, pinning also comes with a [`drop`]-related guarantee.
//!
//! # `Drop` guarantee
//!
//! The purpose of pinning is to be able to rely on the placement of some data in memory.
//! To make this work, not just moving the data is restricted; deallocating, repurposing, or
//! otherwise invalidating the memory used to store the data is restricted, too.
//! Concretely, for pinned data you have to maintain the invariant
//! that *its memory will not get invalidated or repurposed from the moment it gets pinned until
//! when [`drop`] is called*.  Only once [`drop`] returns or panics, the memory may be reused.
//!
//! Memory can be "invalidated" by deallocation, but also by
//! replacing a [`Some(v)`] by [`None`], or calling [`Vec::set_len`] to "kill" some elements
//! off of a vector. It can be repurposed by using [`ptr::write`] to overwrite it without
//! calling the destructor first. None of this is allowed for pinned data without calling [`drop`].
//!
//! This is exactly the kind of guarantee that the intrusive linked list from the previous
//! section needs to function correctly.
//!
//! Notice that this guarantee does *not* mean that memory does not leak! It is still
//! completely okay not ever to call [`drop`] on a pinned element (e.g., you can still
//! call [`mem::forget`] on a [`Pin`]`<`[`Box`]`<T>>`). In the example of the doubly-linked
//! list, that element would just stay in the list. However you may not free or reuse the storage
//! *without calling [`drop`]*.
//!
//! # `Drop` implementation
//!
//! If your type uses pinning (such as the two examples above), you have to be careful
//! when implementing [`Drop`]. The [`drop`] function takes `&mut self`, but this
//! is called *even if your type was previously pinned*! It is as if the
//! compiler automatically called [`Pin::get_unchecked_mut`].
//!
//! This can never cause a problem in safe code because implementing a type that
//! relies on pinning requires unsafe code, but be aware that deciding to make
//! use of pinning in your type (for example by implementing some operation on
//! [`Pin`]`<&Self>` or [`Pin`]`<&mut Self>`) has consequences for your [`Drop`]
//! implementation as well: if an element of your type could have been pinned,
//! you must treat [`Drop`] as implicitly taking [`Pin`]`<&mut Self>`.
//!
//! For example, you could implement `Drop` as follows:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use std::pin::Pin;
//! # struct Type { }
//! impl Drop for Type {
//!     fn drop(&mut self) {
//!         // `new_unchecked` is okay because we know this value is never used
//!         // again after being dropped.
//!         inner_drop(unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(self)});
//!         fn inner_drop(this: Pin<&mut Type>) {
//!             // Actual drop code goes here.
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The function `inner_drop` has the type that [`drop`] *should* have, so this makes sure that
//! you do not accidentally use `self`/`this` in a way that is in conflict with pinning.
//!
//! Moreover, if your type is `#[repr(packed)]`, the compiler will automatically
//! move fields around to be able to drop them. It might even do
//! that for fields that happen to be sufficiently aligned. As a consequence, you cannot use
//! pinning with a `#[repr(packed)]` type.
//!
//! # Projections and Structural Pinning
//!
//! When working with pinned structs, the question arises how one can access the
//! fields of that struct in a method that takes just [`Pin`]`<&mut Struct>`.
//! The usual approach is to write helper methods (so called *projections*)
//! that turn [`Pin`]`<&mut Struct>` into a reference to the field, but what
//! type should that reference have? Is it [`Pin`]`<&mut Field>` or `&mut Field`?
//! The same question arises with the fields of an `enum`, and also when considering
//! container/wrapper types such as [`Vec<T>`], [`Box<T>`], or [`RefCell<T>`].
//! (This question applies to both mutable and shared references, we just
//! use the more common case of mutable references here for illustration.)
//!
//! It turns out that it is actually up to the author of the data structure
//! to decide whether the pinned projection for a particular field turns
//! [`Pin`]`<&mut Struct>` into [`Pin`]`<&mut Field>` or `&mut Field`. There are some
//! constraints though, and the most important constraint is *consistency*:
//! every field can be *either* projected to a pinned reference, *or* have
//! pinning removed as part of the projection. If both are done for the same field,
//! that will likely be unsound!
//!
//! As the author of a data structure you get to decide for each field whether pinning
//! "propagates" to this field or not. Pinning that propagates is also called "structural",
//! because it follows the structure of the type.
//! In the following subsections, we describe the considerations that have to be made
//! for either choice.
//!
//! ## Pinning *is not* structural for `field`
//!
//! It may seem counter-intuitive that the field of a pinned struct might not be pinned,
//! but that is actually the easiest choice: if a [`Pin`]`<&mut Field>` is never created,
//! nothing can go wrong! So, if you decide that some field does not have structural pinning,
//! all you have to ensure is that you never create a pinned reference to that field.
//!
//! Fields without structural pinning may have a projection method that turns
//! [`Pin`]`<&mut Struct>` into `&mut Field`:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use std::pin::Pin;
//! # type Field = i32;
//! # struct Struct { field: Field }
//! impl Struct {
//!     fn pin_get_field(self: Pin<&mut Self>) -> &mut Field {
//!         // This is okay because `field` is never considered pinned.
//!         unsafe { &mut self.get_unchecked_mut().field }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You may also `impl Unpin for Struct` *even if* the type of `field`
//! is not [`Unpin`]. What that type thinks about pinning is not relevant
//! when no [`Pin`]`<&mut Field>` is ever created.
//!
//! ## Pinning *is* structural for `field`
//!
//! The other option is to decide that pinning is "structural" for `field`,
//! meaning that if the struct is pinned then so is the field.
//!
//! This allows writing a projection that creates a [`Pin`]`<&mut Field>`, thus
//! witnessing that the field is pinned:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use std::pin::Pin;
//! # type Field = i32;
//! # struct Struct { field: Field }
//! impl Struct {
//!     fn pin_get_field(self: Pin<&mut Self>) -> Pin<&mut Field> {
//!         // This is okay because `field` is pinned when `self` is.
//!         unsafe { self.map_unchecked_mut(|s| &mut s.field) }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! However, structural pinning comes with a few extra requirements:
//!
//! 1.  The struct must only be [`Unpin`] if all the structural fields are
//!     [`Unpin`]. This is the default, but [`Unpin`] is a safe trait, so as the author of
//!     the struct it is your responsibility *not* to add something like
//!     `impl<T> Unpin for Struct<T>`. (Notice that adding a projection operation
//!     requires unsafe code, so the fact that [`Unpin`] is a safe trait does not break
//!     the principle that you only have to worry about any of this if you use `unsafe`.)
//! 2.  The destructor of the struct must not move structural fields out of its argument. This
//!     is the exact point that was raised in the [previous section][drop-impl]: `drop` takes
//!     `&mut self`, but the struct (and hence its fields) might have been pinned before.
//!     You have to guarantee that you do not move a field inside your [`Drop`] implementation.
//!     In particular, as explained previously, this means that your struct must *not*
//!     be `#[repr(packed)]`.
//!     See that section for how to write [`drop`] in a way that the compiler can help you
//!     not accidentally break pinning.
//! 3.  You must make sure that you uphold the [`Drop` guarantee][drop-guarantee]:
//!     once your struct is pinned, the memory that contains the
//!     content is not overwritten or deallocated without calling the content's destructors.
//!     This can be tricky, as witnessed by [`VecDeque<T>`]: the destructor of [`VecDeque<T>`]
//!     can fail to call [`drop`] on all elements if one of the destructors panics. This violates
//!     the [`Drop`] guarantee, because it can lead to elements being deallocated without
//!     their destructor being called. ([`VecDeque<T>`] has no pinning projections, so this
//!     does not cause unsoundness.)
//! 4.  You must not offer any other operations that could lead to data being moved out of
//!     the structural fields when your type is pinned. For example, if the struct contains an
//!     [`Option<T>`] and there is a `take`-like operation with type
//!     `fn(Pin<&mut Struct<T>>) -> Option<T>`,
//!     that operation can be used to move a `T` out of a pinned `Struct<T>` -- which means
//!     pinning cannot be structural for the field holding this data.
//!
//!     For a more complex example of moving data out of a pinned type, imagine if [`RefCell<T>`]
//!     had a method `fn get_pin_mut(self: Pin<&mut Self>) -> Pin<&mut T>`.
//!     Then we could do the following:
//!     ```compile_fail
//!     fn exploit_ref_cell<T>(rc: Pin<&mut RefCell<T>>) {
//!         { let p = rc.as_mut().get_pin_mut(); } // Here we get pinned access to the `T`.
//!         let rc_shr: &RefCell<T> = rc.into_ref().get_ref();
//!         let b = rc_shr.borrow_mut();
//!         let content = &mut *b; // And here we have `&mut T` to the same data.
//!     }
//!     ```
//!     This is catastrophic, it means we can first pin the content of the [`RefCell<T>`]
//!     (using `RefCell::get_pin_mut`) and then move that content using the mutable
//!     reference we got later.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! For a type like [`Vec<T>`], both possibilities (structural pinning or not) make sense.
//! A [`Vec<T>`] with structural pinning could have `get_pin`/`get_pin_mut` methods to get
//! pinned references to elements. However, it could *not* allow calling
//! [`pop`][Vec::pop] on a pinned [`Vec<T>`] because that would move the (structurally pinned)
//! contents! Nor could it allow [`push`][Vec::push], which might reallocate and thus also move the
//! contents.
//!
//! A [`Vec<T>`] without structural pinning could `impl<T> Unpin for Vec<T>`, because the contents
//! are never pinned and the [`Vec<T>`] itself is fine with being moved as well.
//! At that point pinning just has no effect on the vector at all.
//!
//! In the standard library, pointer types generally do not have structural pinning,
//! and thus they do not offer pinning projections. This is why `Box<T>: Unpin` holds for all `T`.
//! It makes sense to do this for pointer types, because moving the `Box<T>`
//! does not actually move the `T`: the [`Box<T>`] can be freely movable (aka `Unpin`) even if
//! the `T` is not. In fact, even [`Pin`]`<`[`Box`]`<T>>` and [`Pin`]`<&mut T>` are always
//! [`Unpin`] themselves, for the same reason: their contents (the `T`) are pinned, but the
//! pointers themselves can be moved without moving the pinned data. For both [`Box<T>`] and
//! [`Pin`]`<`[`Box`]`<T>>`, whether the content is pinned is entirely independent of whether the
//! pointer is pinned, meaning pinning is *not* structural.
//!
//! When implementing a [`Future`] combinator, you will usually need structural pinning
//! for the nested futures, as you need to get pinned references to them to call [`poll`].
//! But if your combinator contains any other data that does not need to be pinned,
//! you can make those fields not structural and hence freely access them with a
//! mutable reference even when you just have [`Pin`]`<&mut Self>` (such as in your own
//! [`poll`] implementation).

    /// By using this method, you are making a promise about the `P::Deref` and

    /// dereferences to will not be moved out of again; in particular, it
    /// must not be possible to obtain a `&mut P::Target` and then

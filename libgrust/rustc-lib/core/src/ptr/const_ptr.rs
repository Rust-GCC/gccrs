    /// Returns `true` if the pointer is null.

    /// Note that unsized types have many possible null pointers, as only the

    ///
    /// When this function is used during const evaluation, it may return `false` for pointers

    /// is offset beyond its bounds in such a way that the resulting pointer is null,
    /// the function will still return `false`. There is no way for CTFE to know
    /// the absolute position of that memory, so we cannot tell if the pointer is
    /// null or not.

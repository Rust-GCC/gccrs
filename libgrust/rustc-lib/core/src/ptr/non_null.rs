/// `*mut T` but non-zero and covariant.
///
/// This is often the correct thing to use when building data structures using
/// raw pointers, but is ultimately more dangerous to use because of its additional
/// properties. If you're not sure if you should use `NonNull<T>`, just use `*mut T`!
///
/// Unlike `*mut T`, the pointer must always be non-null, even if the pointer
/// is never dereferenced. This is so that enums may use this forbidden value
/// as a discriminant -- `Option<NonNull<T>>` has the same size as `*mut T`.
/// However the pointer may still dangle if it isn't dereferenced.
///
/// Unlike `*mut T`, `NonNull<T>` is covariant over `T`. If this is incorrect
/// for your use case, you should include some [`PhantomData`] in your type to
/// provide invariance, such as `PhantomData<Cell<T>>` or `PhantomData<&'a mut T>`.
/// Usually this won't be necessary; covariance is correct for most safe abstractions,
/// such as `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `Vec`, and `LinkedList`. This is the case because they
/// provide a public API that follows the normal shared XOR mutable rules of Rust.
///
/// Notice that `NonNull<T>` has a `From` instance for `&T`. However, this does
/// not change the fact that mutating through a (pointer derived from a) shared
/// reference is undefined behavior unless the mutation happens inside an
/// [`UnsafeCell<T>`]. The same goes for creating a mutable reference from a shared
/// reference. When using this `From` instance without an `UnsafeCell<T>`,
/// it is your responsibility to ensure that `as_mut` is never called, and `as_ptr`
/// is never used for mutation.

# This script reads program output on STDIN, and out of it produces a block of
# dg-output lines that can be yanked at the end of a file.  It will escape
# special ARE and Tcl constructs automatically.
#
# Each argument passed on the standard input is treated as a string to be
# replaced by ``.*'' in the final result.  This is intended to mask out build
# paths, filenames, etc.
#
# Usage example:

# $ g++-13 -fcontracts -o test \
#  'g++.dg/contracts/contracts-access1.C' && \
#   ./test |& dg-out-generator.pl 'g++.dg/contracts/contracts-access1.C'
# // { dg-output {contract violation in function Base::b at .*:11: pub > 0(\n|\r\n|\r)} }
# // { dg-output {\[level:default, role:default, continuation mode:never\](\n|\r\n|\r)} }
# // { dg-output {terminate called without an active exception(\n|\r\n|\r)} }

# You can now freely dump the above into your testcase.

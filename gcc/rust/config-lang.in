# Configure looks for the existence of this file to auto-config each language.
# We define several parameters used by configure:
#
# language	- name of language as it would appear in $(LANGUAGES)
# compilers	- value to add to $(COMPILERS)
# diff_excludes	- files to ignore when building diffs between two versions.

language="rust"

# Space-separated list of compiler executables that will be run by the driver. The names here will 
# each end with ‘\$(exeext)’. 
compilers="rust1\$(exeext)"

# Do not build by default.

# Lists (space-separated) language front ends other than C that this front end requires to be
# enabled (with the names given being their language settings).

# Lists (space-separated) targets in the top level Makefile to build the runtime libraries 
# for this language, such as target-libobjc.

# Space-separated list of files that should be scanned by gengtype.c to generate the garbage 
# collection tables and routines for this language. This excludes the files that are common to all

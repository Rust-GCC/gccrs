// The backend must define a type named Location which holds
// information about a location in a source file.  The only thing the
// frontend does with instances of Location is pass them back to the
// backend interface.  The Location type must be assignable, and it
// must be comparable: i.e., it must support operator= and operator<.
// The type is normally passed by value rather than by reference, and
// it should support that efficiently.  The type should be defined in
// "rust-location.h".

// The Linemap class is a pure abstract interface, plus some static
// convenience functions.  The backend must implement the interface.

/* TODO: probably better to replace linemap implementation as pure abstract
 * interface with some sort of compile-time switch (macros or maybe templates if
 * doable without too much extra annoyance) as to the definition of the methods
 * or whatever. This is to improve performance, as virtual function calls would
 * otherwise have to be made in tight loops like in the lexer. */

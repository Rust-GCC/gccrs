   * Macros can either be resolved through textual scoping or regular path
   * scoping - which this class represents. Textual scoping works similarly to a
   * "simple" name resolution algorith, with the addition of "shadowing". Each
   * time a new lexical scope is entered, we push a new map onto the stack, in
   * which newly defined macros are added. The latest defined macro is the one
   * that takes precedence. When resolving a macro invocation to its definition,
   * we walk up the stack and look for a definition in each of the map until we
   * find one. Otherwise, the macro invocation is unresolved, and goes through
   * regular path resolution.

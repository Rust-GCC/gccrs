 * For example, if we are resolving the following *variable* use:
 *
 * ```rust
 * fn outer() {
 *     let a = 15; // decl
 *     fn inner() -> i32 {
 *         a // use
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `Function` rib we will have pushed will restrict the access to `outer`'s
 * `a` declaration: Variable uses cannot cross function boundaries. On the other
 * hand, if we were resolving a type usage, this would be perfectly allowed.

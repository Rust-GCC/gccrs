// TODO: Add missing mappings and data structures

/**
The data structures we need to develop need to fill in a few roles - like the
original name resolver, they need to be accessible at multiple points during the
pipeline to allow compiler passes such as macro expansion or typechecking to
benefit from them. Unlike the original name resolution, these data structures
need to be created by multiple compiler passes: Whereas the original name
resolution of gccrs tries to perform name resolution in a single pass, it fails
at properly handling more complex name resolution cases such as macro name
resolution, imports in general, and glob imports in particular. The goal of this
new name resolution algorithm is to split the name resolution in at least two
passes - `Early` name resolution, which takes care of macro name resolution and
import resolution, and `Late` name resolution - your typical name resolution,
for types, functions, variables...

  1. `Early`

  The Early name resolution is tied in snuggly with macro expansion: macro
expansion cannot happen without some form of name resolution (pointing an
invocation to its definition) but may also *depend* on name resolution (a macro
generating another macro... or importing items... and funny other cases like
these). It needs to work in a fixed-point fashion alongside macro expansion:
While there are imports to resolve, or macros to expand, we need to keep going
and resolve them. This is achieved, among other things, by a top-level name
resolution pass in charge of collection use statements and macro definitions (as
well as Items, which will be useful for later passes of the name resolution).

    This top-level pass exists because Rust enables you to call a function
before having declared it (at a lexical level, i.e calling `f(15)` at line 3
while the `f` function is declared at line 1499).

  This Early pass needs to build the first part of our "resolution map", which
will then be used in multiple contexts:

  1. The MacroExpander, in a read-only fashion: fetching macro definitions for
each invocation and performing the expansion.
  2. `Late`, which will write more data inside that resolution map, and use it
to perform its name resolution too.

  This is where the first challenge of this data structure lies: The existing
data structures and name resolution algorithm relies on the name resolution pass
happening just once. In typical name resolution fashion, when it sees a lexical
scope (a new module, a function's block, a block expression...), it "pushes" a
new "Scope" to a stack of these scopes, and "pops" it when exiting said lexical
scope. However, because we are splitting the name resolution into two passes, we
would like to avoid re-doing a bunch of work we've already done - which is why
this data structure needs to allow "re-entrancy", or to at least not keep as
much state as the existing one, and allow for viewing the same module multiple
times without throwing a fit.

  We will be implementing a "forever stack" of scopes, which allows the user the
pushing of new scopes onto the stack, but only simulates the popping of a scope:
When pushing new scopes, more space is allocated on our stack, and we keep
track of this scope as being the current one - however, when popping this scope,
we do not actually delete the memory associated with it: we simply mark the
previous scope (parent) as the current one.

In the example below, each number indicates the "state" of our resolution map,
and the carret is used to point to the current lexical scope.

```rust
		// []
		//
fn main() {     // [ `main` scope: {} ]
		//         ^
  let a = 15;   // [ `main` scope: { Decl(a) } ]
		//         ^
  {  _PUSH_     // [ `main` scope: { Decl(a) }, anonymous scope: {} ]
		//                                        ^
    let a = 16; // [ `main` scope: { Decl(a) }, anonymous scope: { Decl(a) } ]
		//                                        ^
    f(a);       // [ `main` scope: { Decl(a) }, anonymous scope: { Decl(a) } ]
		//                                        ^
  }   _POP_     // [ `main` scope: { Decl(a) }, anonymous scope: { Decl(a) } ]
		//         ^
  f(a);         // [ `main` scope: { Decl(a) }, anonymous scope: { Decl(a) } ]
		//         ^
}
```

This allows us to revisit scopes previously visited in later phases of the name
resolution, and add more information if necessary.

  2. `Late`

  `Late` name resolution possesses some unique challenges since Rust's name
resolution rules are extremely complex - variable shadowing, variable capture in
closures (but not inner functions!)... You can have a look at a fucked up
example here:

https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/name-resolution.html#scopes-and-ribs

This requires us to think about what exactly to put in our `Scope`s and what to
do with our `Rib`s - and how it affects our data structures. For example, in the
above example, `rustc` demonstrates how multiple `Rib`s can be created inside of
a single lexical scope for variables, as the Rust programming language allows
shadowing.

    TODO: Mention macro hygiene and that it is the same
    TODO: How does this affect our data structures?
    TODO: Last challenge - reuse the same APIs to allow the typechecker to not
change?
    TODO: Mention that ForeverStack is templated to make sure that behavior is
correct

public:
  NameResolutionContext ();

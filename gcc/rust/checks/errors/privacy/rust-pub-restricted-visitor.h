/**
 * This visitor takes care of reporting `pub(restricted)` violations:
 * A `pub(restricted)` violation is defined as the usage of a path restriction
 * on an item which does not restrict the item's visibility to one of its parent
 * modules. What this means is that an user is allowed to specify that an item
 * should be public for any of its parent modules, going all the way to the
 * `crate` module, but not for any of its children module.
 *
 * ```rust
 * mod a {
 * 	mod b {
 * 		pub (in a) struct A0;
 *
 * 		mod c {
 * 			mod d {
 * 				pub (in a) struct A1;
 * 			}
 * 		}
 *
 * 		pub (in c::d) struct A2;
 * 	}
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The above `A0`'s visibility is valid: It is restricted to a path, `a`,
 * which is a parent of the current module, `b`.
 * Likewise, `A1` is also defined properly: `a` is a parent of `d`, albeit
 * a great-great-great-grandparant of it.
 *
 * `A2` visibility, however, is invalid: Where the struct is defined, the
 * current module is `b`. `c::d` (which refers to the `d` module) is a child of
 * `b`, and not one of its ancestors.
 *
 * Note that these resolution rules are also the ones of the 2015 rust edition:
 * All the `pub(restricted)` visibilities above would be invalid in the 2018
 * edition, as the paths there must be absolute and not relative (`c::d` would
 * become `crate::a::b::c::d` etc). Nonetheless, the logic stays the same.

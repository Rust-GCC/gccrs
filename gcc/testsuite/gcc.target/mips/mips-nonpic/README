These tests are meant to test the interoperability of PIC and nonpic objects for mips.
This table shows the various combinations and each case is tested by one of the nonpic tests.
Test Case	The PIC code        	The non-PIC code        The result (stub and/or PLT)

main-1.c	nothing           	nothing              	Neither (trivial)
main-2.c	nothing           	call only		PLT entry
main-3.c	nothing           	address taken only	Neither (* But creating a PLT entry is valid)
main-4.c	nothing           	address and call	PLT entry
main-5.c	call only           	nothing			.MIPS.stubs entry
main-6.c	call only           	call only		.MIPS.stubs and PLT
main-7.c	call only           	address taken only	.MIPS.stubs (* Also creating a PLT entry is valid)
main-8.c	call only           	address and call	.MIPS.stubs and PLT entry
main-9.c	address taken only	nothing			Neither
main-10.c	address taken only	call only		PLT entry
main-11.c	address taken only	address taken only	Neither (* But creating a PLT entry is valid)
main-12.c	address taken only	address and call	PLT entry
main-13.c	address and call	nothing			Neither
main-14.c	address and call	call only		PLT entry
main-15.c	address and call	address taken only	Neither (* But creating a PLT entry is valid)
main-16.c	address and call	address and call	PLT entry

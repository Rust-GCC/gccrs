The files in this subdirectory where noted are part of the D2
programming language test suite for the Digitial Mars D compiler,
hosted at https://github.com/dlang/dmd/.

The current git revision number of these tests is maintained in
gcc/d/dmd/MERGE.

The following directories are part of DMD:
  compilable/
  fail_compilation/
  runnable/

All changes to dmd should go through the upstream repository first,
then merged back to GCC.

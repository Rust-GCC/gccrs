Check the test directives used in GCC's testsuite by generating and
running tests that use combinations of those commands or that stress
the selector expressions that can be used in those directives.  Also
run a few tests of specific functionality from the source directory.
                                                                                
Each generated test has two parts: a file ending in "-1.c" whose
expected result is encoded in the filename after "-exp-", and a file
ending in "-2.c" which is always expected to pass.
                                                                                
This test directory is normally skipped and is not meant to be run at
the same time as other parts of the testsuite; it's only of interest to
people who are modifying the test directives or their support in GCC's
.exp files.

To run these tests:
                                                                                
    CHECK_TEST_FRAMEWORK=1 make -k check RUNTESTFLAGS="test-framework.exp"
                                                                                
To check the results:
                                                                                
    TF=${SRC}/gcc/testsuite/gcc.test-framework
    awk -f ${TF}/test-framework.awk gcc/testsuite/gcc/gcc.sum
                                                                                
The awk script prints unexpected results followed by the number of tests
that passed and failed.

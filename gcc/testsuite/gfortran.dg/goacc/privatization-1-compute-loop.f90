! OpenACC privatization: 'loop' construct

! { dg-additional-options "-fopt-info-omp-note" }
! { dg-additional-options "--param=openacc-privatization=noisy" } for
! testing/documenting aspects of that functionality.

! { dg-additional-options -Wuninitialized }

! See also '../../c-c++-common/goacc/privatization-1-compute-loop.c'.
!TODO More cases should be added here.

! It's only with Tcl 8.5 (released in 2007) that "the variable 'varName'
! passed to 'incr' may be unset, and in that case, it will be set to [...]",
! so to maintain compatibility with earlier Tcl releases, we manually
! initialize counter variables:
! { dg-line l_dummy[variable c_compute 0 c_loop 0] }
! { dg-message "dummy" "" { target iN-VAl-Id } l_dummy } to avoid
! "WARNING: dg-line var l_dummy defined, but not used".

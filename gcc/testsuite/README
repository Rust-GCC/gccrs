This is a collection of tests for GCC. For further information about
the C testsuite, see README.gcc.

The driver that runs this testsuite is called DejaGnu and you will
need a current DejaGnu snapshot, which is available from
https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure, for example.

These tests are included "as is". If any of them fails, do not report
a bug.  Bug reports for DejaGnu can go to bug-dejagnu@gnu.org.
Discussion and comments about this testsuite should be sent to
gcc@gcc.gnu.org; additions and changes should be sent to
gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org.

The entire testsuite is invoked by `make check` at the top level of
the GCC tree. `make check-g++` runs the C++ testsuite only.

STRUCTURE OF THE G++ TESTSUITE

  g++.dg tests:

  All new tests should be placed in an appropriate subdirectory of g++.dg.

  g++.old-deja tests:

  g++.benjamin	Tests by Benjamin Koz
  g++.bob
  g++.brendan	Tests by Brendan Kehoe
  g++.bugs
  g++.eh  	Tests for exception handling
  g++.ext  	Tests for g++ extensions
  g++.gb  	Tests by Gerald Baumgartner
  g++.jason	Tests by Jason Merill
  g++.jeff	Tests by Jeffrey A Law
  g++.martin	Tests by Martin v. LÃ¶wis
  g++.mike	Tests by Mike Stump
  g++.niklas	Tests by Niklas Hallqvist
  g++.ns  	Tests for namespaces
  g++.other
  g++.pt  	Tests for templates
  g++.rfg
  g++.robertl	Tests from gcc-bugs@gcc.gnu.org, gathered by Robert Lipe
	
Finally, some random last minute notes by Mike Stump <mrs@cygnus.com>, on
how to run tests (in the GCC 2.7 era):

	runtest --tool g++ --srcdir ./testsuite

where 

	runtest	Is the name used to invoke DejaGnu.   If DejaGnu is not
		installed this will be the relative path name for runtest.

	--tool	This tells DejaGnu which tool you are testing. It is
		mainly used to find the testsuite directories for a
		particular tool when several testsuites are in the
		same directory. (like the gcc and g++ testsuites)

	--srcdir This points to the top level of the directory
		containing the sources of the testsuite. This is
		./testsuite if you are in the directory that has the
		testsuite directory.

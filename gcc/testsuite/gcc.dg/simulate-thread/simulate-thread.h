/* A hostile thread is one which changes a memory location so quickly
   that another thread may never see the same value again.  This is
   simulated when simulate_thread_other_thread() is defined to modify
   a memory location every cycle.

   A process implementing a dependency on this value can run into
   difficulties with such a hostile thread.  For instance,
   implementing an add with a compare_and_swap loop goes something
   like:

     expected = *mem;
   loop:
     new = expected += value;
     if (!succeed (expected = compare_and_swap (mem, expected, new)))
       goto loop;

   If the content of 'mem' are changed every cycle by
   simulate_thread_other_thread () this will become an infinite loop
   since the value *mem will never be 'expected' by the time the
   compare_and_swap is executed.

   HOSTILE_THREAD_THRESHOLD defines the number of intructions which a
   program will execute before triggering the hostile thread
   pause. The pause will last for HOSTILE_THREAD_PAUSE instructions,
   and then the counter will reset and begin again.  During the pause
   period, simulate_thread_other_thread will not be called.

   This provides a chance for forward progress to be made and the
   infinite loop to be avoided.

   If the testcase defines HOSTILE_PAUSE_ERROR, then it will be
   considered a RUNTIME FAILURE if the hostile pause is triggered.
   This will allow to test for guaranteed forward progress routines.

   If the default values for HOSTILE_THREAD_THRESHOLD or
   HOSTILE_THREAD_PAUSE are insufficient, then the testcase may
   override these by defining the values before including this file.

   Most testcase are intended to run for very short periods of time,
   so these defaults are considered to be high enough to not trigger
   on a typical case, but not drag the test time out too much if a
   hostile condition is interferring.  */

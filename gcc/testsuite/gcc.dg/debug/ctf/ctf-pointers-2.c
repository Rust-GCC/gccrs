/* CTF generation for pointer types.

   In this testcase, de-duplication of pointer types is exercised.  The
   compostition of structs in this testcase is such that when adding CTF for
   pointer type (link), the pointed-to-type type already adds the pointer to
   struct link.
   
   In this testcase, one CTF pointer type record is expected.  */

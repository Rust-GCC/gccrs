/* This is a first cut at checking that debug information matches
   run-time.  The idea is to annotate programs with GUALCHK* macros
   that guide the tests.

   In the current implementation, all of the macros expand to function
   calls.  On the one hand, this interferes with optimizations; on the
   other hand, it establishes an optimization barrier and a clear
   inspection point, where previous operations (as in the abstract
   machine) should have been completed and have their effects visible,
   and future operations shouldn't have started yet.

   In the current implementation of guality_check(), we fork a child
   process that runs gdb, attaches to the parent process (the one that
   called guality_check), moves up one stack frame (to the caller of
   guality_check) and then examines the given expression.

   If it matches the expected value, we have a PASS.  If it differs,
   we have a FAILure.  If it is missing, we'll have a FAIL or an
   UNRESOLVED depending on whether the variable or expression might be
   unavailable at that point, as indicated by the third argument.

   We envision a future alternate implementation with two compilation
   and execution cycles, say one that runs the program and uses the
   macros to log expressions and expected values, another in which the
   macros expand to nothing and the logs are used to guide a debug
   session that tests the values.  How to identify the inspection
   points in the second case is yet to be determined.  It is
   recommended that GUALCHK* macros be by themselves in source lines,
   so that __FILE__ and __LINE__ will be usable to identify them.

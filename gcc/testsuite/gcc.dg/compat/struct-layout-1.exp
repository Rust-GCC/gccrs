# Test interoperability of two compilers that follow the same ABI.
#
# Break simple tests into two pieces and see that they work when linked
# together.  If an alternate compiler is specified then the two main
# pieces of each test are compiled with different compilers.  The
# alternate compiler must be installed, and is specified by defining
# ALT_CC_UNDER_TEST in the environment.
#
# struct-layout-1 are generated structure layout interoperability tests,
# so a generator first needs to be compiled on host, run there and the
# generated tests then compiled on build and executed on target.

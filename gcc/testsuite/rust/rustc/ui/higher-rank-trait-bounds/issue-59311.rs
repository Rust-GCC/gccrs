// Regression test for #59311. The test is taken from
// rust-lang/rust/issues/71546#issuecomment-620638437
// as they seem to have the same cause.

// FIXME: It's not clear that this code ought to report
// an error, but the regression test is here to ensure
// that it does not ICE. See discussion on #74889 for details.

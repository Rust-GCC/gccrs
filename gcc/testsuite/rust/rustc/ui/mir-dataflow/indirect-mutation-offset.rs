// This test demonstrates a shortcoming of the `MaybeMutBorrowedLocals` analysis. It does not
// handle code that takes a reference to one field of a struct, then use pointer arithmetic to
// transform it to another field of that same struct that may have interior mutability. For now,
// this is UB, but this may change in the future. See [rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines#134].

// #47295: We used to have a hack of special-casing adjacent amtch
// arms whose patterns were composed solely of constants to not have
// them linked in the cfg.
//
// THis was broken for various reasons. In particular, that hack was
// originally authored under the assunption that other checks
// elsewhere would ensure that the two patterns did not overlap.  But
// that assumption did not hold, at least not in the long run (namely,
// overlapping patterns were turned into warnings rather than errors).

Compiling a context
===================

Once populated, a :class:`gccjit::context` can be compiled to
machine code, either in-memory via :func:`gccjit::context::compile` or
to disk via :func:`gccjit::context::compile_to_file`.

You can compile a context multiple times (using either form of
compilation), although any errors that occur on the context will
prevent any future compilation of that context.

In-memory compilation
*********************

.. function:: gcc_jit_result *\
              gccjit::context::compile ()

   This calls into GCC and builds the code, returning a
   `gcc_jit_result *`.

   This is a thin wrapper around the
   :c:func:`gcc_jit_context_compile` API entrypoint.

Ahead-of-time compilation
*************************

Although libgccjit is primarily aimed at just-in-time compilation, it
can also be used for implementing more traditional ahead-of-time
compilers, via the :func:`gccjit::context::compile_to_file` method.

.. function:: void \
              gccjit::context::compile_to_file (enum gcc_jit_output_kind,\
                                                const char *output_path)

   Compile the :class:`gccjit::context` to a file of the given
   kind.

   This is a thin wrapper around the
   :c:func:`gcc_jit_context_compile_to_file` API entrypoint.

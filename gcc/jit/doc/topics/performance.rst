The timing API
--------------

As of GCC 6, libgccjit exposes a timing API, for printing reports on
how long was spent in different parts of code.

You can create a :c:type:`gcc_jit_timer` instance, which will
measure time spent since its creation.  The timer maintains a stack
of "timer items": as control flow moves through your code, you can push
and pop named items relating to your code onto the stack, and the timer
will account the time spent accordingly.

You can also asssociate a timer with a :c:type:`gcc_jit_context`, in
which case the time spent inside compilation will be subdivided.

For example, the following code uses a timer, recording client items
"create_code", "compile", and "running code":

.. code-block:: c

  /* Create a timer.  */
  gcc_jit_timer *timer = gcc_jit_timer_new ();
  if (!timer)
    {
       error ("gcc_jit_timer_new failed");
       return -1;
    }

  /* Let's repeatedly compile and run some code, accumulating it
     all into the timer.  */
  for (int i = 0; i < num_iterations; i++)
    {
      /* Create a context and associate it with the timer.  */
      gcc_jit_context *ctxt = gcc_jit_context_acquire ();
      if (!ctxt)
        {
          error ("gcc_jit_context_acquire failed");
          return -1;
        }
      gcc_jit_context_set_timer (ctxt, timer);

      /* Populate the context, timing it as client item "create_code".  */
      gcc_jit_timer_push (timer, "create_code");
      create_code (ctxt);
      gcc_jit_timer_pop (timer, "create_code");

      /* Compile the context, timing it as client item "compile".  */
      gcc_jit_timer_push (timer, "compile");
      result = gcc_jit_context_compile (ctxt);
      gcc_jit_timer_pop (timer, "compile");

      /* Run the generated code, timing it as client item "running code".  */
      gcc_jit_timer_push (timer, "running code");
      run_the_code (ctxt, result);
      gcc_jit_timer_pop (timer, "running code");

      /* Clean up.  */
      gcc_jit_context_release (ctxt);
      gcc_jit_result_release (result);
  }

  /* Print the accumulated timings.  */
  gcc_jit_timer_print (timer, stderr);
  gcc_jit_timer_release (timer);

giving output like this, showing the internal GCC items at the top, then
client items, then the total::

.. macro:: LIBGCCJIT_HAVE_TIMING_API

   The timer API was added to libgccjit in GCC 6.
   This macro is only defined in versions of libgccjit.h which have the
   timer API, and so can be used to guard code that may need to compile
   against earlier releases::

     #ifdef LIBGCCJIT_HAVE_TIMING_API
     gcc_jit_timer *t = gcc_jit_timer_new ();
     gcc_jit_context_set_timer (ctxt, t);
     #endif

.. type:: gcc_jit_timer

.. function:: gcc_jit_timer * gcc_jit_timer_new(void)

   Create a :c:type:`gcc_jit_timer` instance, and start timing::

     gcc_jit_timer *t = gcc_jit_timer_new ();

   This API entrypoint was added in :ref:`LIBGCCJIT_ABI_4`; you can test
   for its presence using

   .. code-block:: c

     #ifdef LIBGCCJIT_HAVE_TIMING_API

.. function:: void gcc_jit_timer_release(gcc_jit_timer *timer)

   Release a :c:type:`gcc_jit_timer` instance::

     gcc_jit_timer_release (t);

   This should be called exactly once on a timer.

   This API entrypoint was added in :ref:`LIBGCCJIT_ABI_4`; you can test
   for its presence using

   .. code-block:: c

     #ifdef LIBGCCJIT_HAVE_TIMING_API

.. function:: void gcc_jit_context_set_timer(gcc_jit_context *ctxt, \
                                             gcc_jit_timer *timer)

   Associate a :c:type:`gcc_jit_timer` instance with a context::

      gcc_jit_context_set_timer (ctxt, t);

   A timer instance can be shared between multiple
   :c:type:`gcc_jit_context` instances.

   Timers have no locking, so if you have a multithreaded program, you
   must provide your own locks if more than one thread could be working
   with the same timer via timer-associated contexts.

   This API entrypoint was added in :ref:`LIBGCCJIT_ABI_4`; you can test
   for its presence using

   .. code-block:: c

     #ifdef LIBGCCJIT_HAVE_TIMING_API

.. function:: gcc_jit_timer *gcc_jit_context_get_timer(gcc_jit_context *ctxt)

   Get the timer associated with a context (if any).

   This API entrypoint was added in :ref:`LIBGCCJIT_ABI_4`; you can test
   for its presence using

   .. code-block:: c

     #ifdef LIBGCCJIT_HAVE_TIMING_API

.. function:: void gcc_jit_timer_push(gcc_jit_timer *timer, \
                                      const char *item_name)

   Push the given item onto the timer's stack::

      gcc_jit_timer_push (t, "running code");
      run_the_code (ctxt, result);
      gcc_jit_timer_pop (t, "running code");

   This API entrypoint was added in :ref:`LIBGCCJIT_ABI_4`; you can test
   for its presence using

   .. code-block:: c

     #ifdef LIBGCCJIT_HAVE_TIMING_API

.. function:: void gcc_jit_timer_pop(gcc_jit_timer *timer, \
                                     const char *item_name)

   Pop the top item from the timer's stack.

   If "item_name" is provided, it must match that of the top item.
   Alternatively, ``NULL`` can be passed in, to suppress checking.

   This API entrypoint was added in :ref:`LIBGCCJIT_ABI_4`; you can test
   for its presence using

   .. code-block:: c

     #ifdef LIBGCCJIT_HAVE_TIMING_API

.. function:: void gcc_jit_timer_print(gcc_jit_timer *timer, \
                                       FILE *f_out)

   Print timing information to the given stream about activity since
   the timer was started.

   This API entrypoint was added in :ref:`LIBGCCJIT_ABI_4`; you can test
   for its presence using

   .. code-block:: c

     #ifdef LIBGCCJIT_HAVE_TIMING_API

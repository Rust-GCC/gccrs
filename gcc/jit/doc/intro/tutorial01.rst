Tutorial part 1: "Hello world"
==============================

Before we look at the details of the API, let's look at building and
running programs that use the library.

Here's a toy "hello world" program that uses the library to synthesize
a call to `printf` and uses it to write a message to stdout.

Don't worry about the content of the program for now; we'll cover
the details in later parts of this tutorial.

   .. literalinclude:: ../examples/tut01-hello-world.c
    :language: c

Copy the above to `tut01-hello-world.c`.

Assuming you have the jit library installed, build the test program
using:

.. code-block:: console

  $ gcc \
      tut01-hello-world.c \
      -o tut01-hello-world \
      -lgccjit

You should then be able to run the built program:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ./tut01-hello-world
  hello world

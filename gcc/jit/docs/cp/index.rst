C++ bindings for libgccjit
==========================

This document describes the C++ bindings to
`libgccjit <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/JIT>`_, an API for embedding GCC
inside programs and libraries.

The C++ bindings consist of a single header file ``libgccjit++.h``.

This is a collection of "thin" wrapper classes around the C API.
Everything is an inline function, implemented in terms of the C API,
so there is nothing extra to link against.

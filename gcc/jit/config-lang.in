# Configure looks for the existence of this file to auto-config each language.
# We define several parameters used by configure:

# language	- name of language as it would appear in $(LANGUAGES)
# compilers	- value to add to $(COMPILERS)

language="jit"

compilers=""

# The configuration requires --enable-host-shared
# for jit to be supported (only when not building for Mingw).
# Hence to get the jit, one must configure with:
#   --enable-host-shared --enable-languages=jit

   Each argument conceptually has a gimple-level type.  Usually this type
   is available directly as a tree via the TYPE field, but when calling
   libgcc support functions it might instead be inferred from a mode,
   in which case the type isn't available directly.

   This gimple-level type might go through promotion before being passed to
   the target function.  Depending on the context, the MODE field is either
   the mode of the gimple-level type (whether explicitly given or not)
   or the mode after promotion has been performed.  */

/* The idea is to balance the tree using pseudorandom numbers.  The
   main constraint on this implementation is that we have several
   distinct structures that have to be arranged in a binary tree.
   These structures all contain a BBT_HEADER() in front that gives the
   treap-related information.  The key and value are assumed to reside
   in the rest of the structure.

   When calling, we are also passed a comparison function that
   compares two nodes.  We don't implement a separate 'find' function
   here, but rather use separate functions for each variety of tree.
   We are also restricted to not copy treap structures, which most
   implementations find convenient, because we otherwise would need to
   know how long the structure is.

   This implementation is based on Stefan Nilsson's article in the
   July 1997 Doctor Dobb's Journal, "Treaps in Java".  */

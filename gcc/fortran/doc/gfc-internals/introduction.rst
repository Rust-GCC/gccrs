.. index:: Introduction

This manual documents the internals of :command:`gfortran`,
the GNU Fortran compiler.

.. only:: development

  .. warning::
    This document, and the compiler it describes, are still
    under development.  While efforts are made to keep it up-to-date, it might
    not accurately reflect the status of the most recent GNU Fortran compiler.

.. The following duplicates the text on the TexInfo table of contents.

At present, this manual is very much a work in progress, containing
miscellaneous notes about the internals of the compiler.  It is hoped
that at some point in the future it will become a reasonably complete
guide; in the interim, GNU Fortran developers are strongly encouraged to
contribute to it as a way of keeping notes while working on the
compiler.

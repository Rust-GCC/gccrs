Contributing
============

.. index:: Contributing

Free software is only possible if people contribute to efforts
to create it.
We're always in need of more people helping out with ideas
and comments, writing documentation and contributing code.

If you want to contribute to GNU Fortran,
have a look at the long lists of projects you can take on.
Some of these projects are small,
some of them are large;
some are completely orthogonal to the rest of what is
happening on GNU Fortran,
but others are 'mainstream' projects in need of enthusiastic hackers.
All of these projects are important!
We will eventually get around to the things here,
but they are also things doable by someone who is willing and able.

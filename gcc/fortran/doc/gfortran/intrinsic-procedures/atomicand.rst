ATOMIC_AND --- Atomic bitwise AND operation
*******************************************

.. function:: ATOMIC_AND(ATOM, VALUE)

  ``ATOMIC_AND(ATOM, VALUE)`` atomically defines :samp:`{ATOM}` with the bitwise
  AND between the values of :samp:`{ATOM}` and :samp:`{VALUE}`. When :samp:`{STAT}` is present
  and the invocation was successful, it is assigned the value 0. If it is present
  and the invocation has failed, it is assigned a positive value; in particular,
  for a coindexed :samp:`{ATOM}`, if the remote image has stopped, it is assigned the
  value of ``ISO_FORTRAN_ENV`` 's ``STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE`` and if the remote
  image has failed, the value ``STAT_FAILED_IMAGE``.

  :param ATOM:
    Scalar coarray or coindexed variable of integer
    type with ``ATOMIC_INT_KIND`` kind.

  :param VALUE:
    Scalar of the same type as :samp:`{ATOM}`. If the kind
    is different, the value is converted to the kind of :samp:`{ATOM}`.

  :param STAT:
    (optional) Scalar default-kind integer variable.

  Standard:
    TS 18508 or later

  Class:
    Atomic subroutine

  Syntax:
    .. code-block:: fortran

      CALL ATOMIC_AND (ATOM, VALUE [, STAT])

  Example:
    .. code-block:: fortran

      program atomic
        use iso_fortran_env
        integer(atomic_int_kind) :: atom[*]
        call atomic_and (atom[1], int(b'10100011101'))
      end program atomic

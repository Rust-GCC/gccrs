.. index:: MAXLOC, array, location of maximum element

.. _maxloc:

MAXLOC --- Location of the maximum value within an array
********************************************************

.. function:: MAXLOC(ARRAY , MASK ,KIND ,BACK)

  Determines the location of the element in the array with the maximum
  value, or, if the :samp:`{DIM}` argument is supplied, determines the
  locations of the maximum element along each row of the array in the
  :samp:`{DIM}` direction.  If :samp:`{MASK}` is present, only the elements for
  which :samp:`{MASK}` is ``.TRUE.`` are considered.  If more than one
  element in the array has the maximum value, the location returned is
  that of the first such element in array element order if the
  :samp:`{BACK}` is not present, or is false; if :samp:`{BACK}` is true, the location
  returned is that of the last such element. If the array has zero
  size, or all of the elements of :samp:`{MASK}` are ``.FALSE.``, then
  the result is an array of zeroes.  Similarly, if :samp:`{DIM}` is supplied
  and all of the elements of :samp:`{MASK}` along a given row are zero, the
  result value for that row is zero.

  :param ARRAY:
    Shall be an array of type ``INTEGER`` or
    ``REAL``.

  :param DIM:
    (Optional) Shall be a scalar of type
    ``INTEGER``, with a value between one and the rank of :samp:`{ARRAY}`,
    inclusive.  It may not be an optional dummy argument.

  :param MASK:
    Shall be of type ``LOGICAL``,
    and conformable with :samp:`{ARRAY}`.

  :param KIND:
    (Optional) An ``INTEGER`` initialization
    expression indicating the kind parameter of the result.

  :param BACK:
    (Optional) A scalar of type ``LOGICAL``.

  :return:
    If :samp:`{DIM}` is absent, the result is a rank-one array with a length
    equal to the rank of :samp:`{ARRAY}`.  If :samp:`{DIM}` is present, the result
    is an array with a rank one less than the rank of :samp:`{ARRAY}`, and a
    size corresponding to the size of :samp:`{ARRAY}` with the :samp:`{DIM}`
    dimension removed.  If :samp:`{DIM}` is present and :samp:`{ARRAY}` has a rank
    of one, the result is a scalar.   If the optional argument :samp:`{KIND}`
    is present, the result is an integer of kind :samp:`{KIND}`, otherwise it
    is of default kind.

  Standard:
    Fortran 95 and later; :samp:`{ARRAY}` of ``CHARACTER`` and the
    :samp:`{KIND}` argument are available in Fortran 2003 and later.
    The :samp:`{BACK}` argument is available in Fortran 2008 and later.

  Class:
    Transformational function

  Syntax:
    .. code-block:: fortran

      RESULT = MAXLOC(ARRAY, DIM [, MASK] [,KIND] [,BACK])
      RESULT = MAXLOC(ARRAY [, MASK] [,KIND] [,BACK])

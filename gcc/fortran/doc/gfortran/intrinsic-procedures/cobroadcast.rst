CO_BROADCAST --- Copy a value to all images the current set of images
*********************************************************************

.. index:: CO_BROADCAST, Collectives, value broadcasting

.. function:: CO_BROADCAST(A, SOURCE_IMAGE, STAT, ERRMSG)

  ``CO_BROADCAST`` copies the value of argument :samp:`{A}` on the image with
  image index ``SOURCE_IMAGE`` to all images in the current team.  :samp:`{A}`
  becomes defined as if by intrinsic assignment.  If the execution was
  successful and :samp:`{STAT}` is present, it is assigned the value zero.  If the
  execution failed, :samp:`{STAT}` gets assigned a nonzero value and, if present,
  :samp:`{ERRMSG}` gets assigned a value describing the occurred error.

  :param A:
    INTENT(INOUT) argument; shall have the same
    dynamic type and type parameters on all images of the current team. If it
    is an array, it shall have the same shape on all images.

  :param SOURCE_IMAGE:
    a scalar integer expression.
    It shall have the same value on all images and refer to an
    image of the current team.

  :param STAT:
    (optional) a scalar integer variable

  :param ERRMSG:
    (optional) a scalar character variable

  Standard:
    Technical Specification (TS) 18508 or later

  Class:
    Collective subroutine

  Syntax:
    .. code-block:: fortran

      CALL CO_BROADCAST(A, SOURCE_IMAGE [, STAT, ERRMSG])

  Example:
    .. code-block:: fortran

      program test
        integer :: val(3)
        if (this_image() == 1) then
          val = [1, 5, 3]
        end if
        call co_broadcast (val, source_image=1)
        print *, this_image, ":", val
      end program test

SHAPE --- Determine the shape of an array
*****************************************

.. function:: SHAPE(SOURCE , KIND)

  Determines the shape of an array.

  :param SOURCE:
    Shall be an array or scalar of any type.
    If :samp:`{SOURCE}` is a pointer it must be associated and allocatable
    arrays must be allocated.

  :param KIND:
    (Optional) An ``INTEGER`` initialization
    expression indicating the kind parameter of the result.

  :return:
    An ``INTEGER`` array of rank one with as many elements as :samp:`{SOURCE}`
    has dimensions. The elements of the resulting array correspond to the extend
    of :samp:`{SOURCE}` along the respective dimensions. If :samp:`{SOURCE}` is a scalar,
    the result is the rank one array of size zero. If :samp:`{KIND}` is absent, the
    return value has the default integer kind otherwise the specified kind.

  Standard:
    Fortran 90 and later, with :samp:`{KIND}` argument Fortran 2003 and later

  Class:
    Inquiry function

  Syntax:
    .. code-block:: fortran

      RESULT = SHAPE(SOURCE [, KIND])

  Example:
    .. code-block:: fortran

      PROGRAM test_shape
        INTEGER, DIMENSION(-1:1, -1:2) :: A
        WRITE(*,*) SHAPE(A)             ! (/ 3, 4 /)
        WRITE(*,*) SIZE(SHAPE(42))      ! (/ /)
      END PROGRAM

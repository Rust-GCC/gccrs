MAXVAL --- Maximum value of an array
************************************

.. function:: MAXVAL(ARRAY , MASK)

  Determines the maximum value of the elements in an array value, or, if
  the :samp:`{DIM}` argument is supplied, determines the maximum value along
  each row of the array in the :samp:`{DIM}` direction.  If :samp:`{MASK}` is
  present, only the elements for which :samp:`{MASK}` is ``.TRUE.`` are
  considered.  If the array has zero size, or all of the elements of
  :samp:`{MASK}` are ``.FALSE.``, then the result is ``-HUGE(ARRAY)``
  if :samp:`{ARRAY}` is numeric, or a string of nulls if :samp:`{ARRAY}` is of character
  type.

  :param ARRAY:
    Shall be an array of type ``INTEGER`` or
    ``REAL``.

  :param DIM:
    (Optional) Shall be a scalar of type
    ``INTEGER``, with a value between one and the rank of :samp:`{ARRAY}`,
    inclusive.  It may not be an optional dummy argument.

  :param MASK:
    (Optional) Shall be of type ``LOGICAL``,
    and conformable with :samp:`{ARRAY}`.

  :return:
    If :samp:`{DIM}` is absent, or if :samp:`{ARRAY}` has a rank of one, the result
    is a scalar.  If :samp:`{DIM}` is present, the result is an array with a
    rank one less than the rank of :samp:`{ARRAY}`, and a size corresponding to
    the size of :samp:`{ARRAY}` with the :samp:`{DIM}` dimension removed.  In all
    cases, the result is of the same type and kind as :samp:`{ARRAY}`.

  Standard:
    Fortran 90 and later

  Class:
    Transformational function

  Syntax:
    .. code-block:: fortran

      RESULT = MAXVAL(ARRAY, DIM [, MASK])
      RESULT = MAXVAL(ARRAY [, MASK])

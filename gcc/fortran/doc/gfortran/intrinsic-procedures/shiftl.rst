SHIFTL --- Left shift
*********************

.. index:: SHIFTL, bits, shift left, shift, left

.. function:: SHIFTL(I, SHIFT)

  ``SHIFTL`` returns a value corresponding to :samp:`{I}` with all of the
  bits shifted left by :samp:`{SHIFT}` places.  :samp:`{SHIFT}` shall be
  nonnegative and less than or equal to ``BIT_SIZE(I)``, otherwise
  the result value is undefined.  Bits shifted out from the left end are
  lost, and bits shifted in from the right end are set to 0.

  :param I:
    The type shall be ``INTEGER``.

  :param SHIFT:
    The type shall be ``INTEGER``.

  :return:
    The return value is of type ``INTEGER`` and of the same kind as
    :samp:`{I}`.

  Standard:
    Fortran 2008 and later

  Class:
    Elemental function

  Syntax:
    .. code-block:: fortran

      RESULT = SHIFTL(I, SHIFT)

Environment variables affecting gfortran
****************************************

Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^

The :command:`gfortran` compiler currently does not make use of any environment
variables to control its operation above and beyond those
that affect the operation of :command:`gcc`.

See :ref:`gcc:environment-variables`, for information on environment
variables.

See :ref:`runtime`, for environment variables that affect the
run-time behavior of programs compiled with GNU Fortran.

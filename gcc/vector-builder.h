/* This class is a wrapper around auto_vec<T> for building vectors of T.
   It aims to encode each vector as npatterns interleaved patterns,
   where each pattern represents a sequence:

     { BASE0, BASE1, BASE1 + STEP, BASE1 + STEP*2, BASE1 + STEP*3, ... }

   The first three elements in each pattern provide enough information
   to derive the other elements.  If all patterns have a STEP of zero,
   we only need to encode the first two elements in each pattern.
   If BASE1 is also equal to BASE0 for all patterns, we only need to
   encode the first element in each pattern.  The number of encoded
   elements per pattern is given by nelts_per_pattern.

   The class can be used in two ways:

   1. It can be used to build a full image of the vector, which is then
      canonicalized by finalize ().  In this case npatterns is initially
      the number of elements in the vector and nelts_per_pattern is
      initially 1.

   2. It can be used to build a vector that already has a known encoding.
      This is preferred since it is more efficient and copes with
      variable-length vectors.  finalize () then canonicalizes the encoding
      to a simpler form if possible.

   Shape is the type that specifies the number of elements in the vector
   and (where relevant) the type of each element.

   The derived class Derived provides the functionality of this class
   for specific Ts.  Derived needs to provide the following interface:

      bool equal_p (T elt1, T elt2) const;

	  Return true if elements ELT1 and ELT2 are equal.

      bool allow_steps_p () const;

	  Return true if a stepped representation is OK.  We don't allow
	  linear series for anything other than integers, to avoid problems
	  with rounding.

      bool integral_p (T elt) const;

	  Return true if element ELT can be interpreted as an integer.

      StepType step (T elt1, T elt2) const;

	  Return the value of element ELT2 minus the value of element ELT1,
	  given integral_p (ELT1) && integral_p (ELT2).  There is no fixed
	  choice of StepType.

      T apply_step (T base, unsigned int factor, StepType step) const;

	  Return a vector element with the value BASE + FACTOR * STEP.

      bool can_elide_p (T elt) const;

	  Return true if we can drop element ELT, even if the retained
	  elements are different.  This is provided for TREE_OVERFLOW
	  handling.

      void note_representative (T *elt1_ptr, T elt2);

	  Record that ELT2 is being elided, given that ELT1_PTR points to
	  the last encoded element for the containing pattern.  This is
	  again provided for TREE_OVERFLOW handling.

      static poly_uint64 shape_nelts (Shape shape);

	  Return the number of elements in SHAPE.

    The class provides additional functionality for the case in which
    T can describe a vector constant as well as an individual element.
    This functionality requires:

      static poly_uint64 nelts_of (T x);

	  Return the number of elements in vector constant X.

      static unsigned int npatterns_of (T x);

	  Return the number of patterns used to encode vector constant X.

      static unsigned int nelts_per_pattern_of (T x);

	  Return the number of elements used to encode each pattern
	  in vector constant X.  */

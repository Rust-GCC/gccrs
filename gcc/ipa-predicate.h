   Predicates are logical formulas in conjunctive-disjunctive form consisting

   be true for a clause to be satisfied. Physically they are represented as
   array of clauses terminated by 0.

   be (possibly) true. To make clause (possibly) true, one of conditions
   it mentions must be (possibly) true.

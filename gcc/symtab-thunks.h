/* This symbol annotation holds information about thunk.

   Thunks are basically wrappers around methods which are introduced in case
   of multiple inheritance in order to adjust the value of the "this" pointer
   or of the returned value.

   In the case of this-adjusting thunks, each back-end can override the
   can_output_mi_thunk/output_mi_thunk target hooks to generate a minimal thunk
   (with a tail call for instance) directly as assembly.  For the default hook
   or for the case where the can_output_mi_thunk hooks return false, the thunk
   is gimplified and lowered using the regular machinery.  */

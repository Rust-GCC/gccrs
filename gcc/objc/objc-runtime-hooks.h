/* A set of hooks for the front end to obtain runtime-specific actions.  */

/* Objective-C supports several runtime library variants:

   "GNU" runtime selected by -fgnu-runtime (currently at ABI version 8).
   "NeXT" runtime (selected by -fnext-runtime) and installed on OSX/Darwin
   systems at API version 1 (for m32 code) and version 2 (for m64 code).

   The runtimes require different data types/layouts, method call mechanisms
   and so on, and the purpose of this interface is to abstract such
   differences from the parser's perspective.  */

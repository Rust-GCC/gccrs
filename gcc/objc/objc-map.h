   we currently have maps that can map a GCC identifier (a tree) to
   some other GCC tree.  This is what the ObjC frontend mostly needs:
   being able to look up an identifier into an ObjC data structure.  A
   typical usage is mapping ObjC class names (as identifiers) to a
   tree representing the class.

/**
 ** Iterating over a map using an iterator.
 **/

/* When using iterators you can iterate directly on the elements in
   the map, and take an action over each one.

   Here is how you iterate over a hmap_pointer using iterators:

   objc_map_iterator_t i;

   objc_map_iterator_initialize (map, &i);

   while (objc_map_iterator_move_to_next (map, &i))
     {
       tree p = objc_map_iterator_current_key (map, i);
       tree q = objc_map_iterator_current_value (map, i);

       ... do something with p and q ...
     }

   You'll notice that the functions that modify the iterator (to
   initialize it, or move it to the next element) take a pointer to it
   as argument (as in "&i"), while the functions that only read its
   state (to read the current key/value, or remove the current
   key/value from the map) take it as a direct argument (as in "i").

   Note that all the objc_map_iterator_*() functions are inline and if
   you follow the pattern above, the compiler should be able to inline
   everything into a very efficient loop, roughly equivalent to
   hand-writing a C loop that iterates directly onto the hmap_pointer
   internal data structures.  */

/* A objc_map_iterator_t variable encapsulates the state of an
   iteration.  The fact that this is actually a size_t (pointing to
   the index of the slot that we return next) is an internal, private
   detail of the implementation and may change without notice.  */

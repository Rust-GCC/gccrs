  (* Input and output of real numbers in decimal text form over
     default channels.  The read result is of the type
     IOConsts.ReadResults.

       ["+" | "-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit},

       signed fixed-point real number,

     from the default input channel that form part of a signed
     fixed or floating point number. The value of this number
     is assigned to real.  The read result is set to the value
     allRight, outOfRange, wrongFormat, endOfLine, or endOfInput.

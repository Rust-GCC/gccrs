    Description: provides low level routines for creating and destroying
                 ChanIds.  This is necessary to allow multiple modules
                 to create, ChanId values, where ChanId is an opaque
                 type.

IMPORT FIO, IOLink ;

TYPE

(*
   InitChanId - return a new ChanId.
*)

PROCEDURE InitChanId () : ChanId ;


(*
   KillChanId - deallocate a ChanId.
*)

PROCEDURE KillChanId (c: ChanId) : ChanId ;


(*
   NilChanId - return a NIL pointer.
*)

PROCEDURE NilChanId () : ChanId ;


(*
   GetDeviceId - returns the device id, from, c.

(*
   SetDeviceId - sets the device id in, c.
*)

PROCEDURE SetDeviceId (c: ChanId; d: IOLink.DeviceId) ;

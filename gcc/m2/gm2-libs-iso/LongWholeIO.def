DEFINITION MODULE LongWholeIO;

     over specified channels.  The read result is of the
     type IOConsts.ReadResults.

IMPORT IOChan;

  (* The text form of a signed whole number is
       ["+" | "-"], decimal digit, {decimal digit}

     The text form of an unsigned whole number is
       decimal digit, {decimal digit}
  *)

PROCEDURE ReadInt (cid: IOChan.ChanId; VAR int: LONGINT);
  (* Skips leading spaces, and removes any remaining characters
     from cid that form part of a signed whole number.  The
     value of this number is assigned to int.  The read result
     is set to the value allRight, outOfRange, wrongFormat,
     endOfLine, or endOfInput.
  *)

PROCEDURE WriteInt (cid: IOChan.ChanId; int: LONGINT;
                    width: CARDINAL);
  (* Writes the value of int to cid in text form, in a field of
     the given minimum width. *)

PROCEDURE ReadCard (cid: IOChan.ChanId; VAR card: LONGCARD);
  (* Skips leading spaces, and removes any remaining characters
     from cid that form part of an unsigned whole number.  The
     value of this number is assigned to card. The read result

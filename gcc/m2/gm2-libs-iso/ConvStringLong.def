DEFINITION MODULE ConvStringLong ;

FROM DynamicStrings IMPORT String ;


(*
   RealToFloatString - converts a real with, sigFigs, into a string
                       and returns the result as a string.
*)

PROCEDURE RealToFloatString (real: LONGREAL; sigFigs: CARDINAL) : String ;


(*
   RealToEngString - converts the value of real to floating-point
                     string form, with sigFigs significant figures.
                     The number is scaled with one to three digits
                     in the whole number part and with an exponent
                     that is a multiple of three.
*)

(*
   RealToFixedString - returns the number of characters in the fixed-point
                       string representation of real rounded to the given
                       place relative to the decimal point.

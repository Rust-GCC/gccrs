    Description: provides default FIO based methods for the RTgenif
                 procedures.  These will be used by StreamFile,
                 SeqFile, StdChans, TermFile and RndFile.

   doreadchar - returns a CHAR from the file associated with, g.

(*
   dorbytes - reads upto, max, bytes setting, actual, and
              returning FALSE if an error (not due to eof)
              occurred.

(*
   dowriteln - attempt to write an end of line marker to the
               file and returns TRUE if successful.

   iseof - returns TRUE if end of file has been seen.

DEFINITION MODULE ErrnoCategory ;

(*
   provides an interface to errno (if the system
   supports it) which determines whether the current
   errno is a hard or soft error.  These distinctions
   are needed by the ISO Modula-2 libraries.  Not all
   errno values are tested, only those which could be
   related to a device.
*)

IMPORT ChanConsts ;


(*
   IsErrnoHard - returns TRUE if the value of errno is associated with
                 a hard device error.
*)

PROCEDURE IsErrnoHard (e: INTEGER) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   IsErrnoSoft - returns TRUE if the value of errno is associated with
                 a soft device error.
*)

PROCEDURE IsErrnoSoft (e: INTEGER) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   UnAvailable - returns TRUE if the value of errno indicates that
                 the resource or device is unavailable for some
                 reason.
*)

PROCEDURE UnAvailable (e: INTEGER) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   GetOpenResults - maps errno onto the ISO Modula-2 enumerated
                    type, OpenResults.
*)

PROCEDURE GetOpenResults (e: INTEGER) : ChanConsts.OpenResults ;


END ErrnoCategory.

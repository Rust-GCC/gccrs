These are the base libraries for the GNU Modula-2 compiler.  These
modules originally came from the M2F compiler and have been cleaned up
and extended.  They provide a basic interface to the underlying
operating system via libc.  They also include a number of libraries to
allow access to compiler built-ins. Perhaps the largest difference to
PIM and ISO libraries is the @code{DynamicString} module which
declares the type @code{String}.  The heavy use of this opaque data
type results in a number of equivalent modules that can either handle
@code{ARRAY OF CHAR} or @code{String}.

These modules have been extensively tested and are used throughout
building the GNU Modula-2 compiler.

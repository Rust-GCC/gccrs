PROCEDURE Float (i: INTEGER) : REAL ;


(*
   Trunc - round to the nearest integer not larger in absolute
           value.
*)

PROCEDURE Trunc (r: REAL) : INTEGER ;


(*
   Fracl - returns the fractional component of, r.
*)

PROCEDURE Fracl (r: LONGREAL) : LONGREAL ;


(*
   Intl - returns the integer part of r. It rounds the value towards zero.

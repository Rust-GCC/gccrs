   CalculateFileName - calculates and returns a new string filename
                       given a module and an extension. This file name
                       length will be operating system specific.
                       String, Extension, is concatenated onto
                       Module and thus it is safe to `Mark' the extension
                       for garbage collection.

(*
   CalculateStemName - calculates the stem name for given a module.

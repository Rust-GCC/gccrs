    Description: provides a module to determine whether object files
                 are already known.  An object file will be known by
                 its name and ultimately its inode.

(*
   RegisterModuleObject - returns TRUE if location has not already been registered.
*)

PROCEDURE RegisterModuleObject (fo: FileObjects; location: String) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   IsRegistered - returns TRUE if the object at, location, is already registered.
                  It uses the physical location on the filesystem to determine the
                  uniqueness of the object file.

PROCEDURE IsRegistered (fo: FileObjects; location: String) : BOOLEAN ;


(*
   InitFileObject - returns a new file object container.

PROCEDURE InitFileObject () : FileObjects ;


(*
   KillFileObject - destroys a file object container.

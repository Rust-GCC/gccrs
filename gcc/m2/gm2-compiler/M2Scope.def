(*
   InitScopeBlock - creates a scope block containing all quadruples for the outer, scope.

(*
   KillScopeBlock - destroys the ScopeBlock sb and assign sb to NIL.

PROCEDURE KillScopeBlock (VAR sb: ScopeBlock) ;


(*
   ForeachScopeBlockDo - calls a procedure, p, for each block of contigeous quadruples
                         defining an outer scope, sb.

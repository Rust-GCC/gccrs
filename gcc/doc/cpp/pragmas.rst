Pragmas
-------

The :samp:`#pragma` directive is the method specified by the C standard
for providing additional information to the compiler, beyond what is
conveyed in the language itself.  The forms of this directive
(commonly known as :dfn:`pragmas`) specified by C standard are prefixed with
``STDC``.  A C compiler is free to attach any meaning it likes to other
pragmas.  Most GNU-defined, supported pragmas have been given a
``GCC`` prefix.

.. index:: _Pragma

C99 introduced the ``_Pragma`` operator.  This feature addresses a
major problem with :samp:`#pragma`: being a directive, it cannot be
produced as the result of macro expansion.  ``_Pragma`` is an
operator, much like ``sizeof`` or ``defined``, and can be embedded
in a macro.

Its syntax is ``_Pragma (string-literal)``, where
:samp:`{string-literal}` can be either a normal or wide-character string
literal.  It is destringized, by replacing all :samp:`\\\\` with a single
:samp:`\\` and all :samp:`\\"` with a :samp:`"`.  The result is then
processed as if it had appeared as the right hand side of a
:samp:`#pragma` directive.  For example,

.. code-block:: c++

  _Pragma ("GCC dependency \"parse.y\"")

has the same effect as ``#pragma GCC dependency "parse.y"``.  The
same effect could be achieved using macros, for example

.. code-block:: c++

  #define DO_PRAGMA(x) _Pragma (#x)
  DO_PRAGMA (GCC dependency "parse.y")

The standard is unclear on where a ``_Pragma`` operator can appear.
The preprocessor does not accept it within a preprocessing conditional
directive like :samp:`#if`.  To be safe, you are probably best keeping it
out of directives other than :samp:`#define`, and putting it on a line of
its own.

This manual documents the pragmas which are meaningful to the
preprocessor itself.  Other pragmas are meaningful to the C or C++
compilers.  They are documented in the GCC manual.

GCC plugins may provide their own pragmas.

``#pragma GCC dependency``
  ``#pragma GCC dependency`` allows you to check the relative dates of
  the current file and another file.  If the other file is more recent than
  the current file, a warning is issued.  This is useful if the current
  file is derived from the other file, and should be regenerated.  The
  other file is searched for using the normal include search path.
  Optional trailing text can be used to give more information in the
  warning message.

  .. code-block:: c++

    #pragma GCC dependency "parse.y"
    #pragma GCC dependency "/usr/include/time.h" rerun fixincludes

``#pragma GCC poison``
  Sometimes, there is an identifier that you want to remove completely
  from your program, and make sure that it never creeps back in.  To
  enforce this, you can :dfn:`poison` the identifier with this pragma.
  ``#pragma GCC poison`` is followed by a list of identifiers to
  poison.  If any of those identifiers appears anywhere in the source
  after the directive, it is a hard error.  For example,

  .. code-block:: c++

    #pragma GCC poison printf sprintf fprintf
    sprintf(some_string, "hello");

  will produce an error.

  If a poisoned identifier appears as part of the expansion of a macro
  which was defined before the identifier was poisoned, it will *not*
  cause an error.  This lets you poison an identifier without worrying
  about system headers defining macros that use it.

  For example,

  .. code-block:: c++

    #define strrchr rindex
    #pragma GCC poison rindex
    strrchr(some_string, 'h');

  will not produce an error.

``#pragma GCC system_header``
  This pragma takes no arguments.  It causes the rest of the code in the
  current file to be treated as if it came from a system header.
  See :ref:`system-headers`.

``#pragma GCC warning``, ``#pragma GCC error``
  ``#pragma GCC warning "message"`` causes the preprocessor to issue
  a warning diagnostic with the text :samp:`message`.  The message
  contained in the pragma must be a single string literal.  Similarly,
  ``#pragma GCC error "message"`` issues an error message.  Unlike
  the :samp:`#warning` and :samp:`#error` directives, these pragmas can be
  embedded in preprocessor macros using :samp:`_Pragma`.

``#pragma once``
  If ``#pragma once`` is seen when scanning a header file, that
  file will never be read again, no matter what.  It is a less-portable
  alternative to using :samp:`#ifndef` to guard the contents of header files
  against multiple inclusions.

``#pragma region {tokens}...``, ``#pragma endregion {tokens}...``
  These pragmas are accepted, but have no effect.

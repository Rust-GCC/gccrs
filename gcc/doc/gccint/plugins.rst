Plugins
-------

GCC plugins are loadable modules that provide extra features to the
compiler.  Like GCC itself they can be distributed in source and
binary forms.

GCC plugins provide developers with a rich subset of
the GCC API to allow them to extend GCC as they see fit.
Whether it is writing an additional optimization pass,
transforming code, or analyzing information, plugins
can be quite useful.

RTL Representation of Function-Call Insns
*****************************************

Insns that call subroutines have the RTL expression code ``call_insn``.
These insns must satisfy special rules, and their bodies must use a special
RTL expression code, ``call``.

.. index:: call usage

A ``call`` expression has two operands, as follows:

.. code-block:: c++

  (call (mem:fm addr) nbytes)

Here :samp:`{nbytes}` is an operand that represents the number of bytes of
argument data being passed to the subroutine, :samp:`{fm}` is a machine mode
(which must equal as the definition of the ``FUNCTION_MODE`` macro in
the machine description) and :samp:`{addr}` represents the address of the
subroutine.

For a subroutine that returns no value, the ``call`` expression as
shown above is the entire body of the insn, except that the insn might
also contain ``use`` or ``clobber`` expressions.

.. index:: BLKmode, and function return values

For a subroutine that returns a value whose mode is not ``BLKmode``,
the value is returned in a hard register.  If this register's number is
:samp:`{r}`, then the body of the call insn looks like this:

.. code-block:: c++

  (set (reg:m r)
       (call (mem:fm addr) nbytes))

This RTL expression makes it clear (to the optimizer passes) that the
appropriate register receives a useful value in this insn.

When a subroutine returns a ``BLKmode`` value, it is handled by
passing to the subroutine the address of a place to store the value.
So the call insn itself does not 'return' any value, and it has the
same RTL form as a call that returns nothing.

On some machines, the call instruction itself clobbers some register,
for example to contain the return address.  ``call_insn`` insns
on these machines should have a body which is a ``parallel``
that contains both the ``call`` expression and ``clobber``
expressions that indicate which registers are destroyed.  Similarly,
if the call instruction requires some register other than the stack
pointer that is not explicitly mentioned in its RTL, a ``use``
subexpression should mention that register.

Functions that are called are assumed to modify all registers listed in
the configuration macro ``CALL_USED_REGISTERS`` (see :ref:`register-basics`) and, with the exception of ``const`` functions and library
calls, to modify all of memory.

Insns containing just ``use`` expressions directly precede the
``call_insn`` insn to indicate which registers contain inputs to the
function.  Similarly, if registers other than those in
``CALL_USED_REGISTERS`` are clobbered by the called function, insns
containing a single ``clobber`` follow immediately after the call to
indicate which registers.

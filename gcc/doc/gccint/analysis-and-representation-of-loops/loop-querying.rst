Loop querying
*************

The functions to query the information about loops are declared in
:samp:`cfgloop.h`.  Some of the information can be taken directly from
the structures.  ``loop_father`` field of each basic block contains
the innermost loop to that the block belongs.  The most useful fields of
loop structure (that are kept up-to-date at all times) are:

* ``header``, ``latch`` : Header and latch basic blocks of the
  loop.

* ``num_nodes`` : Number of basic blocks in the loop (including
  the basic blocks of the sub-loops).

* ``outer``, ``inner``, ``next`` : The super-loop, the first
  sub-loop, and the sibling of the loop in the loops tree.

There are other fields in the loop structures, many of them used only by
some of the passes, or not updated during CFG changes; in general, they
should not be accessed directly.

The most important functions to query loop structures are:

* ``loop_depth`` : The depth of the loop in the loops tree, i.e., the
  number of super-loops of the loop.

* ``flow_loops_dump`` : Dumps the information about loops to a
  file.

* ``verify_loop_structure`` : Checks consistency of the loop
  structures.

* ``loop_latch_edge`` : Returns the latch edge of a loop.

* ``loop_preheader_edge`` : If loops have preheaders, returns
  the preheader edge of a loop.

* ``flow_loop_nested_p`` : Tests whether loop is a sub-loop of
  another loop.

* ``flow_bb_inside_loop_p`` : Tests whether a basic block belongs
  to a loop (including its sub-loops).

* ``find_common_loop`` : Finds the common super-loop of two loops.

* ``superloop_at_depth`` : Returns the super-loop of a loop with
  the given depth.

* ``tree_num_loop_insns``, ``num_loop_insns`` : Estimates the
  number of insns in the loop, on GIMPLE and on RTL.

* ``loop_exit_edge_p`` : Tests whether edge is an exit from a
  loop.

* ``mark_loop_exit_edges`` : Marks all exit edges of all loops
  with ``EDGE_LOOP_EXIT`` flag.

* ``get_loop_body``, ``get_loop_body_in_dom_order``,
  ``get_loop_body_in_bfs_order`` : Enumerates the basic blocks in the
  loop in depth-first search order in reversed CFG, ordered by dominance
  relation, and breath-first search order, respectively.

* ``single_exit`` : Returns the single exit edge of the loop, or
  ``NULL`` if the loop has more than one exit.  You can only use this
  function if ``LOOPS_HAVE_RECORDED_EXITS`` is used.

* ``get_loop_exit_edges`` : Enumerates the exit edges of a loop.

* ``just_once_each_iteration_p`` : Returns true if the basic block
  is executed exactly once during each iteration of a loop (that is, it
  does not belong to a sub-loop, and it dominates the latch of the loop).

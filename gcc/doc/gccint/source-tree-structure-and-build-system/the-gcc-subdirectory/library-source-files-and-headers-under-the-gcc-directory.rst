Library Source Files and Headers under the gcc Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. todo:: list here, with explanation, all the C source files and headers
  under the :samp:`gcc` directory that aren't built into the GCC
  executable but rather are part of runtime libraries and object files,
  such as :samp:`crtstuff.c` and :samp:`unwind-dw2.c`.  See :ref:`headers`, for more information about the
  :samp:`ginclude` directory.

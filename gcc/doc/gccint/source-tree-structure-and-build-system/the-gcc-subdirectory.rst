The gcc Subdirectory
********************

The :samp:`gcc` directory contains many files that are part of the C
sources of GCC, other files used as part of the configuration and
build process, and subdirectories including documentation and a
testsuite.  The files that are sources of GCC are documented in a
separate chapter.  See :ref:`passes`.

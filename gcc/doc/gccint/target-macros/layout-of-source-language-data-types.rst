.. _type-layout:

Layout of Source Language Data Types
************************************

These macros define the sizes and other characteristics of the standard
basic data types used in programs being compiled.  Unlike the macros in
the previous section, these apply to specific features of C and related
languages, rather than to fundamental aspects of storage layout.

.. c:macro:: INT_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``int`` on the
  target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

.. c:macro:: SHORT_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``short`` on the
  target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is half a word.
  (If this would be less than one storage unit, it is rounded up to one
  unit.)

.. c:macro:: LONG_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``long`` on the
  target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

.. c:macro:: ADA_LONG_TYPE_SIZE

  On some machines, the size used for the Ada equivalent of the type
  ``long`` by a native Ada compiler differs from that used by C.  In
  that situation, define this macro to be a C expression to be used for
  the size of that type.  If you don't define this, the default is the
  value of ``LONG_TYPE_SIZE``.

.. c:macro:: LONG_LONG_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``long long`` on the
  target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
  words.  If you want to support GNU Ada on your machine, the value of this
  macro must be at least 64.

.. c:macro:: CHAR_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``char`` on the
  target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
  ``BITS_PER_UNIT``.

.. c:macro:: BOOL_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the C++ type ``bool`` and
  C99 type ``_Bool`` on the target machine.  If you don't define
  this, and you probably shouldn't, the default is ``CHAR_TYPE_SIZE``.

.. c:macro:: FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``float`` on the
  target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

.. c:macro:: DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``double`` on the
  target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
  words.

.. c:macro:: LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``long double`` on
  the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
  words.

.. c:macro:: SHORT_FRACT_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``short _Fract`` on
  the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
  ``BITS_PER_UNIT``.

.. c:macro:: FRACT_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``_Fract`` on
  the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
  ``BITS_PER_UNIT * 2``.

.. c:macro:: LONG_FRACT_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``long _Fract`` on
  the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
  ``BITS_PER_UNIT * 4``.

.. c:macro:: LONG_LONG_FRACT_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``long long _Fract`` on
  the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
  ``BITS_PER_UNIT * 8``.

.. c:macro:: SHORT_ACCUM_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``short _Accum`` on
  the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
  ``BITS_PER_UNIT * 2``.

.. c:macro:: ACCUM_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``_Accum`` on
  the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
  ``BITS_PER_UNIT * 4``.

.. c:macro:: LONG_ACCUM_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``long _Accum`` on
  the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
  ``BITS_PER_UNIT * 8``.

.. c:macro:: LONG_LONG_ACCUM_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the type ``long long _Accum`` on
  the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is
  ``BITS_PER_UNIT * 16``.

.. c:macro:: LIBGCC2_GNU_PREFIX

  This macro corresponds to the ``TARGET_LIBFUNC_GNU_PREFIX`` target
  hook and should be defined if that hook is overriden to be true.  It
  causes function names in libgcc to be changed to use a ``__gnu_``
  prefix for their name rather than the default ``__``.  A port which
  uses this macro should also arrange to use :samp:`t-gnu-prefix` in
  the libgcc :samp:`config.host`.

.. c:macro:: WIDEST_HARDWARE_FP_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the widest floating-point format
  supported by the hardware.  If you define this macro, you must specify a
  value less than or equal to the value of ``LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE``.
  If you do not define this macro, the value of ``LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE``
  is the default.

.. c:macro:: DEFAULT_SIGNED_CHAR

  An expression whose value is 1 or 0, according to whether the type
  ``char`` should be signed or unsigned by default.  The user can
  always override this default with the options :option:`-fsigned-char`
  and :option:`-funsigned-char`.

.. include:: tm.rst.in
  :start-after: [TARGET_DEFAULT_SHORT_ENUMS]
  :end-before: [TARGET_DEFAULT_SHORT_ENUMS]


.. c:macro:: SIZE_TYPE

  A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to use
  for size values.  The typedef name ``size_t`` is defined using the
  contents of the string.

  The string can contain more than one keyword.  If so, separate them with
  spaces, and write first any length keyword, then ``unsigned`` if
  appropriate, and finally ``int``.  The string must exactly match one
  of the data type names defined in the function
  ``c_common_nodes_and_builtins`` in the file :samp:`c-family/c-common.cc`.
  You may not omit ``int`` or change the order---that would cause the
  compiler to crash on startup.

  If you don't define this macro, the default is ``"long unsigned
  int"``.

.. c:macro:: SIZETYPE

  GCC defines internal types (``sizetype``, ``ssizetype``,
  ``bitsizetype`` and ``sbitsizetype``) for expressions
  dealing with size.  This macro is a C expression for a string describing
  the name of the data type from which the precision of ``sizetype``
  is extracted.

  The string has the same restrictions as ``SIZE_TYPE`` string.

  If you don't define this macro, the default is ``SIZE_TYPE``.

.. c:macro:: PTRDIFF_TYPE

  A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to use
  for the result of subtracting two pointers.  The typedef name
  ``ptrdiff_t`` is defined using the contents of the string.  See
  ``SIZE_TYPE`` above for more information.

  If you don't define this macro, the default is ``"long int"``.

.. c:macro:: WCHAR_TYPE

  A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to use
  for wide characters.  The typedef name ``wchar_t`` is defined using
  the contents of the string.  See ``SIZE_TYPE`` above for more
  information.

  If you don't define this macro, the default is ``"int"``.

.. c:macro:: WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE

  A C expression for the size in bits of the data type for wide
  characters.  This is used in ``cpp``, which cannot make use of
  ``WCHAR_TYPE``.

.. c:macro:: WINT_TYPE

  A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type to
  use for wide characters passed to ``printf`` and returned from
  ``getwc``.  The typedef name ``wint_t`` is defined using the
  contents of the string.  See ``SIZE_TYPE`` above for more
  information.

  If you don't define this macro, the default is ``"unsigned int"``.

.. c:macro:: INTMAX_TYPE

  A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type that
  can represent any value of any standard or extended signed integer type.
  The typedef name ``intmax_t`` is defined using the contents of the
  string.  See ``SIZE_TYPE`` above for more information.

  If you don't define this macro, the default is the first of
  ``"int"``, ``"long int"``, or ``"long long int"`` that has as
  much precision as ``long long int``.

.. c:macro:: UINTMAX_TYPE

  A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type that
  can represent any value of any standard or extended unsigned integer
  type.  The typedef name ``uintmax_t`` is defined using the contents
  of the string.  See ``SIZE_TYPE`` above for more information.

  If you don't define this macro, the default is the first of
  ``"unsigned int"``, ``"long unsigned int"``, or ``"long long
  unsigned int"`` that has as much precision as ``long long unsigned
  int``.

.. c:macro:: SIG_ATOMIC_TYPE
             INT8_TYPE
             INT16_TYPE
             INT32_TYPE

             UINT16_TYPE
             UINT32_TYPE
             UINT64_TYPE
             INT_LEAST8_TYPE
             INT_LEAST16_TYPE

             UINT_FAST64_TYPE
             INTPTR_TYPE
             UINTPTR_TYPE

  C expressions for the standard types ``sig_atomic_t``,
  ``int8_t``, ``int16_t``, ``int32_t``, ``int64_t``,
  ``uint8_t``, ``uint16_t``, ``uint32_t``, ``uint64_t``,

  ``uint_fast8_t``, ``uint_fast16_t``, ``uint_fast32_t``,
  ``uint_fast64_t``, ``intptr_t``, and ``uintptr_t``.  See
  ``SIZE_TYPE`` above for more information.

  If any of these macros evaluates to a null pointer, the corresponding
  type is not supported; if GCC is configured to provide
  ``<stdint.h>`` in such a case, the header provided may not conform
  to C99, depending on the type in question.  The defaults for all of
  these macros are null pointers.

.. c:macro:: TARGET_PTRMEMFUNC_VBIT_LOCATION

  The C++ compiler represents a pointer-to-member-function with a struct
  that looks like:

  .. code-block:: c++

      struct {
        union {
          void (*fn)();
          ptrdiff_t vtable_index;
        };
        ptrdiff_t delta;
      };

  The C++ compiler must use one bit to indicate whether the function that
  will be called through a pointer-to-member-function is virtual.
  Normally, we assume that the low-order bit of a function pointer must
  always be zero.  Then, by ensuring that the vtable_index is odd, we can
  distinguish which variant of the union is in use.  But, on some
  platforms function pointers can be odd, and so this doesn't work.  In
  that case, we use the low-order bit of the ``delta`` field, and shift
  the remainder of the ``delta`` field to the left.

  GCC will automatically make the right selection about where to store
  this bit using the ``FUNCTION_BOUNDARY`` setting for your platform.
  However, some platforms such as ARM/Thumb have ``FUNCTION_BOUNDARY``
  set such that functions always start at even addresses, but the lowest
  bit of pointers to functions indicate whether the function at that
  address is in ARM or Thumb mode.  If this is the case of your
  architecture, you should define this macro to
  ``ptrmemfunc_vbit_in_delta``.

  In general, you should not have to define this macro.  On architectures
  in which function addresses are always even, according to
  ``FUNCTION_BOUNDARY``, GCC will automatically define this macro to
  ``ptrmemfunc_vbit_in_pfn``.

.. c:macro:: TARGET_VTABLE_USES_DESCRIPTORS

  Normally, the C++ compiler uses function pointers in vtables.  This
  macro allows the target to change to use 'function descriptors'
  instead.  Function descriptors are found on targets for whom a
  function pointer is actually a small data structure.  Normally the
  data structure consists of the actual code address plus a data
  pointer to which the function's data is relative.

  If vtables are used, the value of this macro should be the number
  of words that the function descriptor occupies.

.. c:macro:: TARGET_VTABLE_ENTRY_ALIGN

  By default, the vtable entries are void pointers, the so the alignment
  is the same as pointer alignment.  The value of this macro specifies
  the alignment of the vtable entry in bits.  It should be defined only
  when special alignment is necessary. \*/

.. c:macro:: TARGET_VTABLE_DATA_ENTRY_DISTANCE

  There are a few non-descriptor entries in the vtable at offsets below
  zero.  If these entries must be padded (say, to preserve the alignment
  specified by ``TARGET_VTABLE_ENTRY_ALIGN``), set this to the number
  of words in each data entry.

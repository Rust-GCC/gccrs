How to interpret test results
*****************************

The result of running the testsuite are various :samp:`*.sum` and :samp:`*.log`
files in the testsuite subdirectories.  The :samp:`*.log` files contain a
detailed log of the compiler invocations and the corresponding
results, the :samp:`*.sum` files summarize the results.  These summaries
contain status codes for all tests:

* PASS: the test passed as expected

* XPASS: the test unexpectedly passed

* FAIL: the test unexpectedly failed

* XFAIL: the test failed as expected

* UNSUPPORTED: the test is not supported on this platform

* ERROR: the testsuite detected an error

* WARNING: the testsuite detected a possible problem

It is normal for some tests to report unexpected failures.  At the
current time the testing harness does not allow fine grained control
over whether or not a test is expected to fail.  This problem should
be fixed in future releases.

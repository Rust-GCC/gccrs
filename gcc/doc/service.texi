@chapter How To Get Help with GCC

If you need help installing, using or changing GCC, there are two
ways to find it:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Send a message to a suitable network mailing list.  First try
@email{gcc-help@@gcc.gnu.org} (for help installing or using GCC), and if
that brings no response, try @email{gcc@@gcc.gnu.org}.  For help
changing GCC, ask @email{gcc@@gcc.gnu.org}.  If you think you have found
a bug in GCC, please report it following the instructions at
@pxref{Bug Reporting}.

@item
Look in the service directory for someone who might help you for a fee.
The service directory is found at
@uref{https://www.fsf.org/resources/service}.
@end itemize

SARIF support
=============

`SARIF <https://www.sarif.info/>`_ is a machine-readable format, originally
designed for the output of static analysis tools, but which can be used
for diagnostics in general.

.. function:: void diagnostic_manager_add_sarif_sink (diagnostic_manager *diag_mgr, \
                                                      FILE *dst_stream, \
                                                      const diagnostic_file *main_input_file, \
                                                      enum diagnostic_sarif_version version)

   Add a new output sink to ``diag_mgr``, which writes SARIF of the given
   version to ``dst_stream``.

   The output is not written until ``diag_mgr`` is released.

   ``dst_stream`` is borrowed, and must outlive ``diag_mgr``.

   For the result to be a valid SARIF file according to the schema,
   ``diag_mgr`` must have had :func:`diagnostic_manager_set_tool_name`
   called on it.

   ``diag_mgr``, ``dst_stream``, and ``main_input_file`` must all be non-NULL.

  .. enum:: diagnostic_sarif_version

     An enum for choosing the SARIF version for a SARIF output sink.

     .. macro:: DIAGNOSTIC_SARIF_VERSION_2_1_0

     .. macro:: DIAGNOSTIC_SARIF_VERSION_2_2_PRERELEASE

Invoking gcov
*************

.. code-block::

  gcov [options] files

:command:`gcov` accepts the following options:

Options
^^^^^^^

.. option:: -a, --all-blocks

  Write individual execution counts for every basic block.  Normally gcov
  outputs execution counts only for the main blocks of a line.  With this
  option you can determine if blocks within a single line are not being
  executed.

.. option:: -b, --branch-probabilities

  Write branch frequencies to the output file, and write branch summary
  info to the standard output.  This option allows you to see how often
  each branch in your program was taken.  Unconditional branches will not
  be shown, unless the :option:`-u` option is given.

.. option:: -c, --branch-counts

  Write branch frequencies as the number of branches taken, rather than
  the percentage of branches taken.

.. option:: -d, --display-progress

  Display the progress on the standard output.

.. option:: -f, --function-summaries

  Output summaries for each function in addition to the file level summary.

.. option:: -h, --help

  Display help about using :command:`gcov` (on the standard output), and
  exit without doing any further processing.

.. option:: -j, --json-format

  Output gcov file in an easy-to-parse JSON intermediate format
  which does not require source code for generation.  The JSON
  file is compressed with gzip compression algorithm
  and the files have :samp:`.gcov.json.gz` extension.

  Structure of the JSON is following:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "current_working_directory": "foo/bar",
      "data_file": "a.out",
      "format_version": "1",
      "gcc_version": "11.1.1 20210510"
      "files": ["$file"]
    }

  Fields of the root element have following semantics:

  * :samp:`{current_working_directory}` : working directory where
    a compilation unit was compiled

  * :samp:`{data_file}` : name of the data file (GCDA)

  * :samp:`{format_version}` : semantic version of the format

  * :samp:`{gcc_version}` : version of the GCC compiler

  Each :samp:`{file}` has the following form:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "file": "a.c",
      "functions": ["$function"],
      "lines": ["$line"]
    }

  Fields of the :samp:`{file}` element have following semantics:

  * :samp:`{file_name}` : name of the source file

  Each :samp:`{function}` has the following form:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "blocks": 2,
      "blocks_executed": 2,
      "demangled_name": "foo",
      "end_column": 1,
      "end_line": 4,
      "execution_count": 1,
      "name": "foo",
      "start_column": 5,
      "start_line": 1
    }

  Fields of the :samp:`{function}` element have following semantics:

  * :samp:`{blocks}` : number of blocks that are in the function

  * :samp:`{blocks_executed}` : number of executed blocks of the function

  * :samp:`{demangled_name}` : demangled name of the function

  * :samp:`{end_column}` : column in the source file where the function ends

  * :samp:`{end_line}` : line in the source file where the function ends

  * :samp:`{execution_count}` : number of executions of the function

  * :samp:`{name}` : name of the function

  * :samp:`{start_column}` : column in the source file where the function begins

  * :samp:`{start_line}` : line in the source file where the function begins

  Note that line numbers and column numbers number from 1.  In the current
  implementation, :samp:`{start_line}` and :samp:`{start_column}` do not include
  any template parameters and the leading return type but that
  this is likely to be fixed in the future.

  Each :samp:`{line}` has the following form:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "branches": ["$branch"],
      "count": 2,
      "line_number": 15,
      "unexecuted_block": false,
      "function_name": "foo",
    }

  Branches are present only with :samp:`{-b}` option.
  Fields of the :samp:`{line}` element have following semantics:

  * :samp:`{count}` : number of executions of the line

  * :samp:`{line_number}` : line number

  * :samp:`{unexecuted_block}` : flag whether the line contains an unexecuted block
    (not all statements on the line are executed)

  * :samp:`{function_name}` : a name of a function this :samp:`{line}` belongs to
    (for a line with an inlined statements can be not set)

  Each :samp:`{branch}` has the following form:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "count": 11,
      "fallthrough": true,
      "throw": false
    }

  Fields of the :samp:`{branch}` element have following semantics:

  * :samp:`{count}` : number of executions of the branch

  * :samp:`{fallthrough}` : true when the branch is a fall through branch

  * :samp:`{throw}` : true when the branch is an exceptional branch

.. option:: -H, --human-readable

  Write counts in human readable format (like 24.6k).

.. option:: -k, --use-colors

  Use colors for lines of code that have zero coverage.  We use red color for
  non-exceptional lines and cyan for exceptional.  Same colors are used for
  basic blocks with :option:`-a` option.

.. option:: -l, --long-file-names

  Create long file names for included source files.  For example, if the
  header file :samp:`x.h` contains code, and was included in the file
  :samp:`a.c`, then running :command:`gcov` on the file :samp:`a.c` will
  produce an output file called :samp:`a.c##x.h.gcov` instead of
  :samp:`x.h.gcov`.  This can be useful if :samp:`x.h` is included in
  multiple source files and you want to see the individual
  contributions.  If you use the :samp:`-p` option, both the including
  and included file names will be complete path names.

.. option:: -m, --demangled-names

  Display demangled function names in output. The default is to show
  mangled function names.

.. option:: -n, --no-output

  Do not create the :command:`gcov` output file.


.. option:: -o directory|file, --object-directory directory, --object-file file

  Specify either the directory containing the gcov data files, or the
  object path name.  The :samp:`.gcno`, and
  :samp:`.gcda` data files are searched for using this option.  If a directory
  is specified, the data files are in that directory and named after the
  input file name, without its extension.  If a file is specified here,
  the data files are named after that file, without its extension.

.. option:: -p, --preserve-paths

  Preserve complete path information in the names of generated
  :samp:`.gcov` files.  Without this option, just the filename component is
  used.  With this option, all directories are used, with :samp:`/` characters
  translated to :samp:`#` characters, :samp:`.` directory components
  removed and unremoveable :samp:`..`
  components renamed to :samp:`^`.  This is useful if sourcefiles are in several
  different directories.

.. option:: -q, --use-hotness-colors

  Emit perf-like colored output for hot lines.  Legend of the color scale
  is printed at the very beginning of the output file.

.. option:: -r, --relative-only

  Only output information about source files with a relative pathname
  (after source prefix elision).  Absolute paths are usually system
  header files and coverage of any inline functions therein is normally
  uninteresting.

.. option:: -s directory, --source-prefix directory

  A prefix for source file names to remove when generating the output
  coverage files.  This option is useful when building in a separate
  directory, and the pathname to the source directory is not wanted when
  determining the output file names.  Note that this prefix detection is
  applied before determining whether the source file is absolute.

.. option:: -t, --stdout

  Output to standard output instead of output files.

.. option:: -u, --unconditional-branches

  When branch probabilities are given, include those of unconditional branches.
  Unconditional branches are normally not interesting.

.. option:: -v, --version

  Display the :command:`gcov` version number (on the standard output),
  and exit without doing any further processing.

.. option:: -w, --verbose

  Print verbose informations related to basic blocks and arcs.

.. option:: -x, --hash-filenames

  When using :samp:`{--preserve-paths}`,
  gcov uses the full pathname of the source files to create
  an output filename.  This can lead to long filenames that can overflow
  filesystem limits.  This option creates names of the form
  :samp:`{source-file}##{md5}.gcov`,
  where the :samp:`{source-file}` component is the final filename part and
  the :samp:`{md5}` component is calculated from the full mangled name that
  would have been used otherwise.  The option is an alternative
  to the :samp:`{--preserve-paths}` on systems which have a filesystem limit.

:command:`gcov` should be run with the current directory the same as that
when you invoked the compiler.  Otherwise it will not be able to locate
the source files.  :command:`gcov` produces files called
:samp:`{mangledname}.gcov` in the current directory.  These contain
the coverage information of the source file they correspond to.
One :samp:`.gcov` file is produced for each source (or header) file
containing code,
which was compiled to produce the data files.  The :samp:`{mangledname}` part
of the output file name is usually simply the source file name, but can
be something more complicated if the :samp:`-l` or :samp:`-p` options are
given.  Refer to those options for details.

If you invoke :command:`gcov` with multiple input files, the
contributions from each input file are summed.  Typically you would
invoke it with the same list of files as the final link of your executable.

The :samp:`.gcov` files contain the :samp:`:` separated fields along with
program source code.  The format is

.. code-block::

  execution_count:line_number:source line text

Additional block information may succeed each line, when requested by
command line option.  The :samp:`{execution_count}` is :samp:`-` for lines
containing no code.  Unexecuted lines are marked :samp:`#####` or
:samp:`=====`, depending on whether they are reachable by
non-exceptional paths or only exceptional paths such as C++ exception
handlers, respectively. Given the :samp:`-a` option, unexecuted blocks are
marked :samp:`$$$$$` or :samp:`%%%%%`, depending on whether a basic block
is reachable via non-exceptional or exceptional paths.
Executed basic blocks having a statement with zero :samp:`{execution_count}`
end with :samp:`*` character and are colored with magenta color with
the :option:`-k` option.  This functionality is not supported in Ada.

Note that GCC can completely remove the bodies of functions that are
not needed -- for instance if they are inlined everywhere.  Such functions
are marked with :samp:`-`, which can be confusing.
Use the :option:`-fkeep-inline-functions` and :option:`-fkeep-static-functions`
options to retain these functions and
allow gcov to properly show their :samp:`{execution_count}`.

Some lines of information at the start have :samp:`{line_number}` of zero.
These preamble lines are of the form

:option:`-:0:tag` : :samp:`{value}`
The ordering and number of these preamble lines will be augmented as
:command:`gcov` development progresses --- do not rely on them remaining
unchanged.  Use :samp:`{tag}` to locate a particular preamble line.

The additional block information is of the form

.. code-block::

  tag information

The :samp:`{information}` is human readable, but designed to be simple
enough for machine parsing too.

When printing percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed when the values
are *exactly* 0% and 100% respectively.  Other values which would
conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100% are instead printed as the
nearest non-boundary value.

When using :command:`gcov`, you must first compile your program
with a special GCC option :samp:`--coverage`.
This tells the compiler to generate additional information needed by
gcov (basically a flow graph of the program) and also includes
additional code in the object files for generating the extra profiling
information needed by gcov.  These additional files are placed in the
directory where the object file is located.

Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For each
source file compiled with :option:`-fprofile-arcs`, an accompanying
:samp:`.gcda` file will be placed in the object file directory.

Running :command:`gcov` with your program's source file names as arguments
will now produce a listing of the code along with frequency of execution
for each line.  For example, if your program is called :samp:`tmp.cpp`, this
is what you see when you use the basic :command:`gcov` facility:

.. code-block:: shell-session

  $ g++ --coverage tmp.cpp -c
  $ g++ --coverage tmp.o
  $ a.out
  $ gcov tmp.cpp -m
  File 'tmp.cpp'
  Lines executed:92.86% of 14
  Creating 'tmp.cpp.gcov'

The file :samp:`tmp.cpp.gcov` contains output from :command:`gcov`.
Here is a sample:

.. code-block::

          -:    0:Source:tmp.cpp
          -:    0:Working directory:/home/gcc/testcase
          -:    0:Graph:tmp.gcno
          -:    0:Data:tmp.gcda
          -:    0:Runs:1
          -:    0:Programs:1
          -:    1:#include <stdio.h>
          -:    2:
          -:    3:template<class T>
          -:    4:class Foo
          -:    5:{
          -:    6:  public:
         1*:    7:  Foo(): b (1000) {}
  ------------------
  Foo<char>::Foo():
      #####:    7:  Foo(): b (1000) {}
  ------------------
  Foo<int>::Foo():
          1:    7:  Foo(): b (1000) {}
  ------------------
         2*:    8:  void inc () { b++; }
  ------------------
  Foo<char>::inc():
      #####:    8:  void inc () { b++; }
  ------------------
  Foo<int>::inc():
          2:    8:  void inc () { b++; }
  ------------------
          -:    9:
          -:   10:  private:
          -:   11:  int b;
          -:   12:};
          -:   13:
          -:   14:template class Foo<int>;
          -:   15:template class Foo<char>;
          -:   16:
          -:   17:int
          1:   18:main (void)
          -:   19:{
          -:   20:  int i, total;
          1:   21:  Foo<int> counter;
          -:   22:
          1:   23:  counter.inc();
          1:   24:  counter.inc();
          1:   25:  total = 0;
          -:   26:
         11:   27:  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
         10:   28:    total += i;
          -:   29:
         1*:   30:  int v = total > 100 ? 1 : 2;
          -:   31:
          1:   32:  if (total != 45)
      #####:   33:    printf ("Failure\n");
          -:   34:  else
          1:   35:    printf ("Success\n");
          1:   36:  return 0;
          -:   37:}

Note that line 7 is shown in the report multiple times.  First occurrence
presents total number of execution of the line and the next two belong
to instances of class Foo constructors.  As you can also see, line 30 contains
some unexecuted basic blocks and thus execution count has asterisk symbol.

When you use the :option:`-a` option, you will get individual block
counts, and the output looks like this:

.. code-block::

          -:    0:Source:tmp.cpp
          -:    0:Working directory:/home/gcc/testcase
          -:    0:Graph:tmp.gcno
          -:    0:Data:tmp.gcda
          -:    0:Runs:1
          -:    0:Programs:1
          -:    1:#include <stdio.h>
          -:    2:
          -:    3:template<class T>
          -:    4:class Foo
          -:    5:{
          -:    6:  public:
         1*:    7:  Foo(): b (1000) {}
  ------------------
  Foo<char>::Foo():
      #####:    7:  Foo(): b (1000) {}
  ------------------
  Foo<int>::Foo():
          1:    7:  Foo(): b (1000) {}
  ------------------
         2*:    8:  void inc () { b++; }
  ------------------
  Foo<char>::inc():
      #####:    8:  void inc () { b++; }
  ------------------
  Foo<int>::inc():
          2:    8:  void inc () { b++; }
  ------------------
          -:    9:
          -:   10:  private:
          -:   11:  int b;
          -:   12:};
          -:   13:
          -:   14:template class Foo<int>;
          -:   15:template class Foo<char>;
          -:   16:
          -:   17:int
          1:   18:main (void)
          -:   19:{
          -:   20:  int i, total;
          1:   21:  Foo<int> counter;
          1:   21-block  0
          -:   22:
          1:   23:  counter.inc();
          1:   23-block  0
          1:   24:  counter.inc();
          1:   24-block  0
          1:   25:  total = 0;
          -:   26:
         11:   27:  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
          1:   27-block  0
         11:   27-block  1
         10:   28:    total += i;
         10:   28-block  0
          -:   29:
         1*:   30:  int v = total > 100 ? 1 : 2;
          1:   30-block  0
      %%%%%:   30-block  1
          1:   30-block  2
          -:   31:
          1:   32:  if (total != 45)
          1:   32-block  0
      #####:   33:    printf ("Failure\n");
      %%%%%:   33-block  0
          -:   34:  else
          1:   35:    printf ("Success\n");
          1:   35-block  0
          1:   36:  return 0;
          1:   36-block  0
          -:   37:}

In this mode, each basic block is only shown on one line -- the last
line of the block.  A multi-line block will only contribute to the
execution count of that last line, and other lines will not be shown
to contain code, unless previous blocks end on those lines.
The total execution count of a line is shown and subsequent lines show
the execution counts for individual blocks that end on that line.  After each
block, the branch and call counts of the block will be shown, if the
:option:`-b` option is given.

Because of the way GCC instruments calls, a call count can be shown
after a line with no individual blocks.
As you can see, line 33 contains a basic block that was not executed.

When you use the :option:`-b` option, your output looks like this:

For each function, a line is printed showing how many times the function
is called, how many times it returns and what percentage of the
function's blocks were executed.

For each basic block, a line is printed after the last line of the basic
block describing the branch or call that ends the basic block.  There can
be multiple branches and calls listed for a single source line if there
are multiple basic blocks that end on that line.  In this case, the
branches and calls are each given a number.  There is no simple way to map
these branches and calls back to source constructs.  In general, though,
the lowest numbered branch or call will correspond to the leftmost construct
on the source line.

For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the branch was taken divided by the
number of times the branch was executed will be printed.  Otherwise, the
message 'never executed' is printed.

For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the call returned divided by the number
of times the call was executed will be printed.  This will usually be
100%, but may be less for functions that call ``exit`` or ``longjmp``,
and thus may not return every time they are called.

The execution counts are cumulative.  If the example program were
executed again without removing the :samp:`.gcda` file, the count for the
number of times each line in the source was executed would be added to
the results of the previous run(s).  This is potentially useful in
several ways.  For example, it could be used to accumulate data over a
number of program runs as part of a test verification suite, or to
provide more accurate long-term information over a large number of
program runs.

The data in the :samp:`.gcda` files is saved immediately before the program
exits.  For each source file compiled with :option:`-fprofile-arcs`, the
profiling code first attempts to read in an existing :samp:`.gcda` file; if
the file doesn't match the executable (differing number of basic block
counts) it will ignore the contents of the file.  It then adds in the
new execution counts and finally writes the data to the file.

Extensions to the C++ Language
------------------------------

The GNU compiler provides these extensions to the C++ language (and you
can also use most of the C language extensions in your C++ programs).  If you
want to write code that checks whether these features are available, you can
test for the GNU compiler the same way as for C programs: check for a
predefined macro ``__GNUC__``.  You can also use ``__GNUG__`` to
test specifically for GNU C++ (see :ref:`cpp:common-predefined-macros`).

Statement Attributes
********************

GCC allows attributes to be set on null statements.  See :ref:`attribute-syntax`,
for details of the exact syntax for using attributes.  Other attributes are
available for functions (see :ref:`function-attributes`), variables
(see :ref:`variable-attributes`), labels (see :ref:`label-attributes`), enumerators
(see :ref:`enumerator-attributes`), and for types (see :ref:`type-attributes`).

``fallthrough``

  .. index:: fallthrough statement attribute

  The ``fallthrough`` attribute with a null statement serves as a
  fallthrough statement.  It hints to the compiler that a statement
  that falls through to another case label, or user-defined label
  in a switch statement is intentional and thus the
  :option:`-Wimplicit-fallthrough` warning must not trigger.  The
  fallthrough attribute may appear at most once in each attribute
  list, and may not be mixed with other attributes.  It can only
  be used in a switch statement (the compiler will issue an error
  otherwise), after a preceding statement and before a logically
  succeeding case label, or user-defined label.

  This example uses the ``fallthrough`` statement attribute to indicate that
  the :option:`-Wimplicit-fallthrough` warning should not be emitted:

  .. code-block:: c++

    switch (cond)
      {
      case 1:
        bar (1);
        __attribute__((fallthrough));
      case 2:
        ...
      }

``assume``

  .. index:: assume statement attribute

  The ``assume`` attribute with a null statement serves as portable
  assumption.  It should have a single argument, a conditional expression,
  which is not evaluated.  If the argument would evaluate to true
  at the point where it appears, it has no effect, otherwise there
  is undefined behavior.  This is a GNU variant of the ISO C++23
  standard ``assume`` attribute, but it can be used in any version of
  both C and C++.

  .. code-block:: c++

    int
    foo (int x, int y)
    {
      __attribute__((assume(x == 42)));
      __attribute__((assume(++y == 43)));
      return x + y;
    }

  ``y`` is not actually incremented and the compiler can but does not
  have to optimize it to just ``return 42 + 42;``.

PowerPC AltiVec/VSX Built-in Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GCC provides an interface for the PowerPC family of processors to access
the AltiVec operations described in Motorola's AltiVec Programming
Interface Manual.  The interface is made available by including
``<altivec.h>`` and using :option:`-maltivec` and
:option:`-mabi=altivec`.  The interface supports the following vector
types.

.. code-block:: c++

  vector unsigned char
  vector signed char
  vector bool char

  vector unsigned short
  vector signed short
  vector bool short
  vector pixel

  vector unsigned int
  vector signed int
  vector bool int
  vector float

GCC's implementation of the high-level language interface available from
C and C++ code differs from Motorola's documentation in several ways.

* A vector constant is a list of constant expressions within curly braces.

* A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of the
  same type as the variable it is initializing.

* If ``signed`` or ``unsigned`` is omitted, the signedness of the
  vector type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
  varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program should
  always specify the signedness.

* Compiling with :option:`-maltivec` adds keywords ``__vector``,
  ``vector``, ``__pixel``, ``pixel``, ``__bool`` and
  ``bool``.  When compiling ISO C, the context-sensitive substitution
  of the keywords ``vector``, ``pixel`` and ``bool`` is
  disabled.  To use them, you must include ``<altivec.h>`` instead.

* GCC allows using a ``typedef`` name as the type specifier for a
  vector type, but only under the following circumstances:

  * When using ``__vector`` instead of ``vector`` ; for example,

    .. code-block:: c++

      typedef signed short int16;
      __vector int16 data;

  * When using ``vector`` in keyword-and-predefine mode; for example,

    .. code-block:: c++

      typedef signed short int16;
      vector int16 data;

    Note that keyword-and-predefine mode is enabled by disabling GNU
    extensions (e.g., by using ``-std=c11``) and including
    ``<altivec.h>``.

* For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the following
  does not work:

  .. code-block:: c++

      vec_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);

  Since ``vec_add`` is a macro, the vector constant in the example
  is treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
  parentheses for this to work.

.. note::

  Only the ``<altivec.h>`` interface is supported.
  Internally, GCC uses built-in functions to achieve the functionality in
  the aforementioned header file, but they are not supported and are
  subject to change without notice.

GCC complies with the Power Vector Intrinsic Programming Reference (PVIPR),
which may be found at
https://openpowerfoundation.org/?resource_lib=power-vector-intrinsic-programming-reference.
Chapter 4 of this document fully documents the vector API interfaces
that must be
provided by compliant compilers.  Programmers should preferentially use
the interfaces described therein.  However, historically GCC has provided
additional interfaces for access to vector instructions.  These are
briefly described below.  Where the PVIPR provides a portable interface,
other functions in GCC that provide the same capabilities should be
considered deprecated.

The PVIPR documents the following overloaded functions:

PowerPC AltiVec Built-in Functions on ISA 2.05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following interfaces are supported for the generic and specific
AltiVec operations and the AltiVec predicates.  In cases where there
is a direct mapping between generic and specific operations, only the
generic names are shown here, although the specific operations can also
be used.

Arguments that are documented as ``const int`` require literal
integral values within the range required for that operation.

Only functions excluded from the PVIPR are listed here.

PowerPC AltiVec Built-in Functions Available on ISA 2.06
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AltiVec built-in functions described in this section are
available on the PowerPC family of processors starting with ISA 2.06
or later.  These are normally enabled by adding :option:`-mvsx` to the
command line.

When :option:`-mvsx` is used, the following additional vector types are
implemented.

.. code-block:: c++

  vector unsigned __int128
  vector signed __int128
  vector unsigned long long int
  vector signed long long int

The ``scalar_extract_exp`` and ``scalar_extract_sig``
functions require a 64-bit environment supporting ISA 3.0 or later.
The ``scalar_extract_exp`` and ``scalar_extract_sig`` built-in
functions return the significand and the biased exponent value
respectively of their ``source`` arguments.
When supplied with a 64-bit ``source`` argument, the
result returned by ``scalar_extract_sig`` has
the ``0x0010000000000000`` bit set if the
function's ``source`` argument is in normalized form.
Otherwise, this bit is set to 0.
When supplied with a 128-bit ``source`` argument, the
``0x00010000000000000000000000000000`` bit of the result is
treated similarly.
Note that the sign of the significand is not represented in the result
returned from the ``scalar_extract_sig`` function.  Use the
``scalar_test_neg`` function to test the sign of its ``double``
argument.

The ``scalar_insert_exp``
functions require a 64-bit environment supporting ISA 3.0 or later.
When supplied with a 64-bit first argument, the
``scalar_insert_exp`` built-in function returns a double-precision
floating point value that is constructed by assembling the values of its
``significand`` and ``exponent`` arguments.  The sign of the
result is copied from the most significant bit of the
``significand`` argument.  The significand and exponent components
of the result are composed of the least significant 11 bits of the
``exponent`` argument and the least significant 52 bits of the
``significand`` argument respectively.

When supplied with a 128-bit first argument, the
``scalar_insert_exp`` built-in function returns a quad-precision
ieee floating point value.  The sign bit of the result is copied from
the most significant bit of the ``significand`` argument.
The significand and exponent components of the result are composed of
the least significant 15 bits of the ``exponent`` argument and the
least significant 112 bits of the ``significand`` argument respectively.

The ``scalar_cmp_exp_gt``, ``scalar_cmp_exp_lt``,
``scalar_cmp_exp_eq``, and ``scalar_cmp_exp_unordered`` built-in
functions return a non-zero value if ``arg1`` is greater than, less
than, equal to, or not comparable to ``arg2`` respectively.  The
arguments are not comparable if one or the other equals NaN (not a
number).

The ``scalar_test_data_class`` built-in function returns 1
if any of the condition tests enabled by the value of the
``condition`` variable are true, and 0 otherwise.  The
``condition`` argument must be a compile-time constant integer with
value not exceeding 127.  The
``condition`` argument is encoded as a bitmask with each bit
enabling the testing of a different condition, as characterized by the
following:

.. code-block:: c++

  0x40    Test for NaN
  0x20    Test for +Infinity
  0x10    Test for -Infinity
  0x08    Test for +Zero
  0x04    Test for -Zero
  0x02    Test for +Denormal
  0x01    Test for -Denormal

The ``scalar_test_neg`` built-in function returns 1 if its
``source`` argument holds a negative value, 0 otherwise.

The following built-in functions are also available for the PowerPC family
of processors, starting with ISA 3.0 or later
(:option:`-mcpu=power9`).  These string functions are described
separately in order to group the descriptions closer to the function
prototypes.

Only functions excluded from the PVIPR are listed here.

.. code-block:: c++

  int vec_all_nez (vector signed char, vector signed char);
  int vec_all_nez (vector unsigned char, vector unsigned char);

  unsigned char vec_xrx (unsigned int index, vector unsigned char data);
  signed short vec_xrx (unsigned int index, vector signed short data);
  unsigned short vec_xrx (unsigned int index, vector unsigned short data);
  signed int vec_xrx (unsigned int index, vector signed int data);
  unsigned int vec_xrx (unsigned int index, vector unsigned int data);
  float vec_xrx (unsigned int index, vector float data);

The ``vec_all_nez``, ``vec_any_eqz``, and ``vec_cmpnez``
perform pairwise comparisons between the elements at the same
positions within their two vector arguments.
The ``vec_all_nez`` function returns a
non-zero value if and only if all pairwise comparisons are not
equal and no element of either vector argument contains a zero.
The ``vec_any_eqz`` function returns a
non-zero value if and only if at least one pairwise comparison is equal
or if at least one element of either vector argument contains a zero.
The ``vec_cmpnez`` function returns a vector of the same type as
its two arguments, within which each element consists of all ones to
denote that either the corresponding elements of the incoming arguments are
not equal or that at least one of the corresponding elements contains
zero.  Otherwise, the element of the returned vector contains all zeros.

The ``vec_xlx`` and ``vec_xrx`` functions extract the single
element selected by the ``index`` argument from the vector
represented by the ``data`` argument.  The ``index`` argument
always specifies a byte offset, regardless of the size of the vector
element.  With ``vec_xlx``, ``index`` is the offset of the first
byte of the element to be extracted.  With ``vec_xrx``, ``index``
represents the last byte of the element to be extracted, measured
from the right end of the vector.  In other words, the last byte of
the element to be extracted is found at position ``(15 - index)``.
There is no requirement that ``index`` be a multiple of the vector
element size.  However, if the size of the vector element added to
``index`` is greater than 15, the content of the returned value is
undefined.

The following functions are also available if the ISA 3.0 instruction
set additions (:option:`-mcpu=power9`) are available.

  __vector unsigned short
  vec_absdh (__vector unsigned short arg1, __vector unsigned short arg2);
  __vector unsigned int
  vec_absdw (__vector unsigned int arg1, __vector unsigned int arg2);

The ``vec_absd``, ``vec_absdb``, ``vec_absdh``, and
``vec_absdw`` built-in functions each computes the absolute
differences of the pairs of vector elements supplied in its two vector
arguments, placing the absolute differences into the corresponding
elements of the vector result.

The following built-in functions are available for the PowerPC family
of processors, starting with ISA 3.0 or later (:option:`-mcpu=power9`):

  vector unsigned long long vec_vrlnm (vector unsigned long long,
                                       vector unsigned long long);

The result of ``vec_vrlnm`` is obtained by rotating each element
of the first argument vector left and ANDing it with a mask.  The
second argument vector contains the mask  beginning in bits 11:15,
the mask end in bits 19:23, and the shift count in bits 27:31,
of each element.

The second argument to :samp:`{__builtin_crypto_vshasigmad}` and
:samp:`{__builtin_crypto_vshasigmaw}` must be a constant
integer that is 0 or 1.  The third argument to these built-in functions
must be a constant integer in the range of 0 to 15.

The following sign extension builtins are provided:

.. code-block:: c++

  vector signed int vec_signexti (vector signed char a);
  vector signed long long vec_signextll (vector signed char a);
  vector signed int vec_signexti (vector signed short a);
  vector signed long long vec_signextll (vector signed short a);
  vector signed long long vec_signextll (vector signed int a);
  vector signed long long vec_signextq (vector signed long long a);

Each element of the result is produced by sign-extending the element of the
input vector that would fall in the least significant portion of the result
element. For example, a sign-extension of a vector signed char to a vector
signed long long will sign extend the rightmost byte of each doubleword.

  vec_clrl (vector unsigned char a, unsigned int n);

Clear the left-most ``(16 - n)`` bytes of vector argument ``a``, as if
implemented by the ``vclrlb`` instruction on a big-endian target
and by the ``vclrrb`` instruction on a little-endian target.  A
value of ``n`` that is greater than 16 is treated as if it equaled 16.

.. index:: vec_clrl

.. code-block:: c++

  vector signed char
  vec_clrr (vector signed char a, unsigned int n);
  vector unsigned char
  vec_clrr (vector unsigned char a, unsigned int n);

Clear the right-most ``(16 - n)`` bytes of vector argument ``a``, as if
implemented by the ``vclrrb`` instruction on a big-endian target
and by the ``vclrlb`` instruction on a little-endian target.  A
value of ``n`` that is greater than 16 is treated as if it equaled 16.

.. index:: vec_clrr

.. code-block:: c++

  vector unsigned long long int
  vec_gnb (vector unsigned __int128, const unsigned char);

Perform a 128-bit vector gather  operation, as if implemented by the

  vector unsigned long long int
  vec_extractl (vector unsigned int, vector unsigned int, unsigned int);
  vector unsigned long long int
  vec_extractl (vector unsigned long long, vector unsigned long long, unsigned int);

Extract an element from two concatenated vectors starting at the given byte index
in natural-endian order, and place it zero-extended in doubleword 1 of the result
according to natural element order.  If the byte index is out of range for the
data type, the intrinsic will be rejected.
For little-endian, this output will match the placement by the hardware
instruction, i.e., dword[0] in RTL notation.  For big-endian, an additional
instruction is needed to move it from the "left" doubleword to the  "right" one.
For little-endian, semantics matching the ``vextdubvrx``,
``vextduhvrx``, ``vextduwvrx`` instruction will be generated, while for
big-endian, semantics matching the ``vextdubvlx``, ``vextduhvlx``,
``vextduwvlx`` instructions
will be generated.  Note that some fairly anomalous results can be generated if
the byte index is not aligned on an element boundary for the element being
extracted.  This is a limitation of the bi-endian vector programming model is
consistent with the limitation on ``vec_perm``.

.. index:: vec_extractl

  vector unsigned long long intvec_extracth (vector unsigned long long, vector unsigned long long,unsigned int);

Extract an element from two concatenated vectors starting at the given byte
index.  The index is based on big endian order for a little endian system.
Similarly, the index is based on little endian order for a big endian system.
The extraced elements are zero-extended and put in doubleword 1
according to natural element order.  If the byte index is out of range for the
data type, the intrinsic will be rejected.  For little-endian, this output
will match the placement by the hardware instruction (vextdubvrx, vextduhvrx,
vextduwvrx, vextddvrx) i.e., dword[0] in RTL
notation.  For big-endian, an additional instruction is needed to move it
from the "left" doubleword to the "right" one.  For little-endian, semantics
matching the ``vextdubvlx``, ``vextduhvlx``, ``vextduwvlx``
instructions will be generated, while for big-endian, semantics matching the
``vextdubvrx``, ``vextduhvrx``, ``vextduwvrx`` instructions will
be generated.  Note that some fairly anomalous
results can be generated if the byte index is not aligned on the
element boundary for the element being extracted.  This is a
limitation of the bi-endian vector programming model consistent with the
limitation on ``vec_perm``.

.. index:: vec_extracth

.. code-block:: c++

  vector unsigned long long int
  vec_pdep (vector unsigned long long int, vector unsigned long long int);

Perform a vector parallel bits deposit operation, as if implemented by
the ``vpdepd`` instruction.

  vector unsigned shortvec_insertl (vector unsigned short, vector unsigned short,unsigned int);
  vector unsigned intvec_insertl (vector unsigned int, vector unsigned int, unsigned int);

Let src be the first argument, when the first argument is a scalar, or the
rightmost element of the left doubleword of the first argument, when the first
argument is a vector.  Insert the source into the destination at the position
given by the third argument, using natural element order in the second
argument.  The rest of the second argument is unchanged.  If the byte
index is greater than 14 for halfwords, greater than 12 for words, or
greater than 8 for doublewords the result is undefined.   For little-endian,
the generated code will be semantically equivalent to ``vins[bhwd]rx``
instructions.  Similarly for big-endian it will be semantically equivalent
to ``vins[bhwd]lx``.  Note that some fairly anomalous results can be
generated if the byte index is not aligned on an element boundary for the
type of element being inserted.

  vector unsigned intvec_inserth (vector unsigned int, vector unsigned int, unsigned int);

Let src be the first argument, when the first argument is a scalar, or the
rightmost element of the first argument, when the first argument is a vector.
Insert src into the second argument at the position identified by the third
argument, using opposite element order in the second argument, and leaving the
rest of the second argument unchanged.  If the byte index is greater than 14
for halfwords, 12 for words, or 8 for doublewords, the intrinsic will be
rejected. Note that the underlying hardware instruction uses the same register
for the second argument and the result.
For little-endian, the code generation will be semantically equivalent to
``vins[bhwd]lx``, while for big-endian it will be semantically equivalent to
``vins[bhwd]rx``.
Note that some fairly anomalous results can be generated if the byte index is
not aligned on an element boundary for the sort of element being inserted.

Vector Replace Element

.. code-block:: c++

  vector unsigned long long vec_replace_elt (vector unsigned long long,unsigned long long, const int);
  vector double rec_replace_elt (vector double, double, const int);

The third argument (constrained to [0,3]) identifies the natural-endian
element number of the first argument that will be replaced by the second
argument to produce the result.  The other elements of the first argument will
remain unchanged in the result.

If it's desirable to insert a word at an unaligned position, use
vec_replace_unaligned instead.

  vector unsigned char vec_replace_unaligned (vector unsigned char,unsigned long long, const int);
  vector unsigned char vec_replace_unaligned (vector unsigned char,double, const int);

The second argument replaces a portion of the first argument to produce the
result, with the rest of the first argument unchanged in the result.  The
third argument identifies the byte index (using left-to-right, or big-endian
order) where the high-order byte of the second argument will be placed, with

Common Function Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following attributes are supported on most targets.

.. Keep this table alphabetized by attribute name.  Treat _ as space.

.. fn-attr:: access (access-mode, ref-index), access (access-mode, ref-index, size-index)

  The :fn-attr:`access` attribute enables the detection of invalid or unsafe
  accesses by functions to which they apply or their callers, as well as
  write-only accesses to objects that are never read from.  Such accesses
  may be diagnosed by warnings such as :option:`-Wstringop-overflow`,
  :option:`-Wuninitialized`, :option:`-Wunused`, and others.

  The :fn-attr:`access` attribute specifies that a function to whose by-reference
  arguments the attribute applies accesses the referenced object according to
  :samp:`{access-mode}`.  The :samp:`{access-mode}` argument is required and must be
  one of four names: ``read_only``, ``read_write``, ``write_only``,
  or ``none``.  The remaining two are positional arguments.

  The required :samp:`{ref-index}` positional argument  denotes a function
  argument of pointer (or in C++, reference) type that is subject to
  the access.  The same pointer argument can be referenced by at most one
  distinct :fn-attr:`access` attribute.

  The optional :samp:`{size-index}` positional argument denotes a function
  argument of integer type that specifies the maximum size of the access.
  The size is the number of elements of the type referenced by :samp:`{ref-index}`,
  or the number of bytes when the pointer type is ``void*``.  When no
  :samp:`{size-index}` argument is specified, the pointer argument must be either
  null or point to a space that is suitably aligned and large for at least one
  object of the referenced type (this implies that a past-the-end pointer is
  not a valid argument).  The actual size of the access may be less but it
  must not be more.

  The ``read_only`` access mode specifies that the pointer to which it
  applies is used to read the referenced object but not write to it.  Unless
  the argument specifying the size of the access denoted by :samp:`{size-index}`
  is zero, the referenced object must be initialized.  The mode implies
  a stronger guarantee than the ``const`` qualifier which, when cast away
  from a pointer, does not prevent the pointed-to object from being modified.
  Examples of the use of the ``read_only`` access mode is the argument to
  the ``puts`` function, or the second and third arguments to
  the ``memcpy`` function.

  .. code-block:: c++

    __attribute__ ((access (read_only, 1))) int puts (const char*);
    __attribute__ ((access (read_only, 2, 3))) void* memcpy (void*, const void*, size_t);

  The ``read_write`` access mode applies to arguments of pointer types
  without the ``const`` qualifier.  It specifies that the pointer to which
  it applies is used to both read and write the referenced object.  Unless
  the argument specifying the size of the access denoted by :samp:`{size-index}`
  is zero, the object referenced by the pointer must be initialized.  An example
  of the use of the ``read_write`` access mode is the first argument to
  the ``strcat`` function.

  .. code-block:: c++

    __attribute__ ((access (read_write, 1), access (read_only, 2))) char* strcat (char*, const char*);

  The ``write_only`` access mode applies to arguments of pointer types
  without the ``const`` qualifier.  It specifies that the pointer to which
  it applies is used to write to the referenced object but not read from it.
  The object referenced by the pointer need not be initialized.  An example
  of the use of the ``write_only`` access mode is the first argument to
  the ``strcpy`` function, or the first two arguments to the ``fgets``
  function.

  .. code-block:: c++

    __attribute__ ((access (write_only, 1), access (read_only, 2))) char* strcpy (char*, const char*);
    __attribute__ ((access (write_only, 1, 2), access (read_write, 3))) int fgets (char*, int, FILE*);

  The access mode ``none`` specifies that the pointer to which it applies
  is not used to access the referenced object at all.  Unless the pointer is
  null the pointed-to object must exist and have at least the size as denoted
  by the :samp:`{size-index}` argument.  When the optional :samp:`{size-index}`
  argument is omitted for an argument of ``void*`` type the actual pointer
  agument is ignored.  The referenced object need not be initialized.
  The mode is intended to be used as a means to help validate the expected
  object size, for example in functions that call ``__builtin_object_size``.
  See :ref:`object-size-checking`.

  Note that the ``access`` attribute merely specifies how an object
  referenced by the pointer argument can be accessed; it does not imply that
  an access **will** happen.  Also, the ``access`` attribute does not
  imply the attribute :fn-attr:`nonnull` ; it may be appropriate to add both attributes
  at the declaration of a function that unconditionally manipulates a buffer via
  a pointer argument.  See the :fn-attr:`nonnull` attribute for more information and
  caveats.

.. index:: alias function attribute

.. fn-attr:: alias ("target")

  The ``alias`` attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as an alias
  for another symbol, which must have been previously declared with the same
  type, and for variables, also the same size and alignment.  Declaring an alias
  with a different type than the target is undefined and may be diagnosed.  As
  an example, the following declarations:

  .. code-block:: c++

    void __f () { /* Do something. */; }
    void f () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("__f")));

  define :samp:`f` to be a weak alias for :samp:`__f`.  In C++, the mangled name
  for the target must be used.  It is an error if :samp:`__f` is not defined in
  the same translation unit.

  This attribute requires assembler and object file support,
  and may not be available on all targets.

.. index:: aligned function attribute

.. fn-attr:: aligned, aligned (alignment)

  The :fn-attr:`aligned` attribute specifies a minimum alignment for
  the first instruction of the function, measured in bytes.  When specified,
  :samp:`{alignment}` must be an integer constant power of 2.  Specifying no
  :samp:`{alignment}` argument implies the ideal alignment for the target.
  The ``__alignof__`` operator can be used to determine what that is
  (see :ref:`alignment`).  The attribute has no effect when a definition for
  the function is not provided in the same translation unit.

  The attribute cannot be used to decrease the alignment of a function
  previously declared with a more restrictive alignment; only to increase
  it.  Attempts to do otherwise are diagnosed.  Some targets specify
  a minimum default alignment for functions that is greater than 1.  On
  such targets, specifying a less restrictive alignment is silently ignored.
  Using the attribute overrides the effect of the :option:`-falign-functions`
  (see :ref:`optimize-options`) option for this function.

  Note that the effectiveness of :fn-attr:`aligned` attributes may be
  limited by inherent limitations in the system linker
  and/or object file format.  On some systems, the
  linker is only able to arrange for functions to be aligned up to a
  certain maximum alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported
  alignment may be very very small.)  See your linker documentation for
  further information.

  The :fn-attr:`aligned` attribute can also be used for variables and fields
  (see :ref:`variable-attributes`.)

.. index:: alloc_align function attribute

.. fn-attr:: alloc_align (position)

  The ``alloc_align`` attribute may be applied to a function that
  returns a pointer and takes at least one argument of an integer or
  enumerated type.
  It indicates that the returned pointer is aligned on a boundary given
  by the function argument at :samp:`{position}`.  Meaningful alignments are
  powers of 2 greater than one.  GCC uses this information to improve
  pointer alignment analysis.

  The function parameter denoting the allocated alignment is specified by
  one constant integer argument whose number is the argument of the attribute.
  Argument numbering starts at one.

  For instance,

  .. code-block:: c++

    void* my_memalign (size_t, size_t) __attribute__ ((alloc_align (1)));

  declares that ``my_memalign`` returns memory with minimum alignment
  given by parameter 1.

.. index:: alloc_size function attribute

.. fn-attr:: alloc_size (position), alloc_size (position-1, position-2)

  The ``alloc_size`` attribute may be applied to a function that
  returns a pointer and takes at least one argument of an integer or
  enumerated type.
  It indicates that the returned pointer points to memory whose size is
  given by the function argument at :samp:`{position-1}`, or by the product
  of the arguments at :samp:`{position-1}` and :samp:`{position-2}`.  Meaningful
  sizes are positive values less than ``PTRDIFF_MAX``.  GCC uses this
  information to improve the results of ``__builtin_object_size``.

  The function parameter(s) denoting the allocated size are specified by
  one or two integer arguments supplied to the attribute.  The allocated size
  is either the value of the single function argument specified or the product
  of the two function arguments specified.  Argument numbering starts at
  one for ordinary functions, and at two for C++ non-static member functions.

  For instance,

  .. code-block:: c++

    void* my_calloc (size_t, size_t) __attribute__ ((alloc_size (1, 2)));
    void* my_realloc (void*, size_t) __attribute__ ((alloc_size (2)));

  declares that ``my_calloc`` returns memory of the size given by
  the product of parameter 1 and 2 and that ``my_realloc`` returns memory
  of the size given by parameter 2.

.. index:: always_inline function attribute

.. fn-attr:: always_inline

  Generally, functions are not inlined unless optimization is specified.
  For functions declared inline, this attribute inlines the function
  independent of any restrictions that otherwise apply to inlining.
  Failure to inline such a function is diagnosed as an error.
  Note that if such a function is called indirectly the compiler may
  or may not inline it depending on optimization level and a failure
  to inline an indirect call may or may not be diagnosed.

.. index:: artificial function attribute

.. fn-attr:: artificial

  This attribute is useful for small inline wrappers that if possible
  should appear during debugging as a unit.  Depending on the debug
  info format it either means marking the function as artificial
  or using the caller location for all instructions within the inlined
  body.

.. index:: assume_aligned function attribute

.. fn-attr:: assume_aligned (alignment), assume_aligned (alignment, offset)

  The ``assume_aligned`` attribute may be applied to a function that
  returns a pointer.  It indicates that the returned pointer is aligned
  on a boundary given by :samp:`{alignment}`.  If the attribute has two
  arguments, the second argument is misalignment :samp:`{offset}`.  Meaningful
  values of :samp:`{alignment}` are powers of 2 greater than one.  Meaningful
  values of :samp:`{offset}` are greater than zero and less than :samp:`{alignment}`.

  For instance

  .. code-block:: c++

    void* my_alloc1 (size_t) __attribute__((assume_aligned (16)));
    void* my_alloc2 (size_t) __attribute__((assume_aligned (32, 8)));

  declares that ``my_alloc1`` returns 16-byte aligned pointers and
  that ``my_alloc2`` returns a pointer whose value modulo 32 is equal
  to 8.

.. index:: cold function attribute

.. fn-attr:: cold

  The :fn-attr:`cold` attribute on functions is used to inform the compiler that
  the function is unlikely to be executed.  The function is optimized for
  size rather than speed and on many targets it is placed into a special
  subsection of the text section so all cold functions appear close together,
  improving code locality of non-cold parts of program.  The paths leading
  to calls of cold functions within code are marked as unlikely by the branch
  prediction mechanism.  It is thus useful to mark functions used to handle
  unlikely conditions, such as ``perror``, as cold to improve optimization
  of hot functions that do call marked functions in rare occasions.

  When profile feedback is available, via :option:`-fprofile-use`, cold functions
  are automatically detected and this attribute is ignored.

.. index:: const function attribute, functions that have no side effects

.. fn-attr:: const

  Calls to functions whose return value is not affected by changes to
  the observable state of the program and that have no observable effects
  on such state other than to return a value may lend themselves to
  optimizations such as common subexpression elimination.  Declaring such
  functions with the :option:`const` attribute allows GCC to avoid emitting
  some calls in repeated invocations of the function with the same argument
  values.

  For example,

  .. code-block:: c++

    int square (int) __attribute__ ((const));

  tells GCC that subsequent calls to function ``square`` with the same
  argument value can be replaced by the result of the first call regardless
  of the statements in between.

  The :option:`const` attribute prohibits a function from reading objects
  that affect its return value between successive invocations.  However,
  functions declared with the attribute can safely read objects that do
  not change their return value, such as non-volatile constants.

  The :fn-attr:`const` attribute imposes greater restrictions on a function's
  definition than the similar :fn-attr:`pure` attribute.  Declaring the same
  function with both the :fn-attr:`const` and the :fn-attr:`pure` attribute is
  diagnosed.  Because a const function cannot have any observable side
  effects it does not make sense for it to return ``void``.  Declaring
  such a function is diagnosed.

  .. index:: pointer arguments

  Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the data
  pointed to must *not* be declared :option:`const` if the pointed-to
  data might change between successive invocations of the function.  In
  general, since a function cannot distinguish data that might change
  from data that cannot, const functions should never take pointer or,
  in C++, reference arguments. Likewise, a function that calls a non-const
  function usually must not be const itself.

.. index:: constructor function attribute, destructor function attribute

.. fn-attr:: constructor, destructor, constructor (priority), destructor (priority)

  The :fn-attr:`constructor` attribute causes the function to be called
  automatically before execution enters ``main ()``.  Similarly, the
  ``destructor`` attribute causes the function to be called
  automatically after ``main ()`` completes or ``exit ()`` is
  called.  Functions with these attributes are useful for
  initializing data that is used implicitly during the execution of
  the program.

  On some targets the attributes also accept an integer argument to
  specify a priority to control the order in which constructor and
  destructor functions are run.  A constructor
  with a smaller priority number runs before a constructor with a larger
  priority number; the opposite relationship holds for destructors.  Note
  that priorities 0-100 are reserved.  So, if you have a constructor that
  allocates a resource and a destructor that deallocates the same
  resource, both functions typically have the same priority.  The
  priorities for constructor and destructor functions are the same as
  those specified for namespace-scope C++ objects (see :ref:`c++-attributes`).
  However, at present, the order in which constructors for C++ objects
  with static storage duration and functions decorated with attribute
  :fn-attr:`constructor` are invoked is unspecified. In mixed declarations,
  attribute ``init_priority`` can be used to impose a specific ordering.

  Using the argument forms of the :fn-attr:`constructor` and ``destructor``
  attributes on targets where the feature is not supported is rejected with
  an error.

.. index:: copy function attribute

.. fn-attr:: copy, copy (function)

  The :fn-attr:`copy` attribute applies the set of attributes with which
  :samp:`{function}` has been declared to the declaration of the function
  to which the attribute is applied.  The attribute is designed for
  libraries that define aliases or function resolvers that are expected
  to specify the same set of attributes as their targets.  The :fn-attr:`copy`
  attribute can be used with functions, variables, or types.  However,
  the kind of symbol to which the attribute is applied (either function
  or variable) must match the kind of symbol to which the argument refers.
  The :fn-attr:`copy` attribute copies only syntactic and semantic attributes
  but not attributes that affect a symbol's linkage or visibility such as
  ``alias``, :fn-attr:`visibility`, or :fn-attr:`weak`.  The :fn-attr:`deprecated`
  and ``target_clones`` attribute are also not copied.
  See :ref:`common-type-attributes`.
  See :ref:`common-variable-attributes`.

  For example, the :samp:`{StrongAlias}` macro below makes use of the ``alias``
  and :fn-attr:`copy` attributes to define an alias named :samp:`{alloc}` for function
  :samp:`{allocate}` declared with attributes :samp:`{alloc_size}`, :samp:`{malloc}`, and
  :samp:`{nothrow}`.  Thanks to the ``__typeof__`` operator the alias has
  the same type as the target function.  As a result of the :fn-attr:`copy`
  attribute the alias also shares the same attributes as the target.

  .. code-block:: c++

    #define StrongAlias(TargetFunc, AliasDecl)  \
      extern __typeof__ (TargetFunc) AliasDecl  \
        __attribute__ ((alias (#TargetFunc), copy (TargetFunc)));

    extern __attribute__ ((alloc_size (1), malloc, nothrow))
      void* allocate (size_t);
    StrongAlias (allocate, alloc);

.. index:: deprecated function attribute

.. fn-attr:: deprecated, deprecated (msg)

  The :fn-attr:`deprecated` attribute results in a warning if the function
  is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
  functions that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
  program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
  of the deprecated function, to enable users to easily find further
  information about why the function is deprecated, or what they should
  do instead.  Note that the warnings only occurs for uses:

  .. code-block:: c++

    int old_fn () __attribute__ ((deprecated));
    int old_fn ();
    int (*fn_ptr)() = old_fn;

  results in a warning on line 3 but not line 2.  The optional :samp:`{msg}`
  argument, which must be a string, is printed in the warning if
  present.

  The :fn-attr:`deprecated` attribute can also be used for variables and
  types (see :ref:`variable-attributes`, see :ref:`type-attributes`.)

  The message attached to the attribute is affected by the setting of
  the :option:`-fmessage-length` option.

.. index:: unavailable function attribute

.. fn-attr:: unavailable, unavailable (msg)

  The :fn-attr:`unavailable` attribute results in an error if the function
  is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
  functions that have been removed from a particular variation of an
  interface.  Other than emitting an error rather than a warning, the
  :fn-attr:`unavailable` attribute behaves in the same manner as
  :fn-attr:`deprecated`.

  The :fn-attr:`unavailable` attribute can also be used for variables and
  types (see :ref:`variable-attributes`, see :ref:`type-attributes`.)

.. index:: error function attribute, warning function attribute

.. fn-attr:: error ("message"), warning ("message")

  If the ``error`` or ``warning`` attribute
  is used on a function declaration and a call to such a function
  is not eliminated through dead code elimination or other optimizations,
  an error or warning (respectively) that includes :samp:`{message}` is diagnosed.
  This is useful
  for compile-time checking, especially together with ``__builtin_constant_p``
  and inline functions where checking the inline function arguments is not
  possible through ``extern char [(condition) ? 1 : -1];`` tricks.

  While it is possible to leave the function undefined and thus invoke
  a link failure (to define the function with
  a message in ``.gnu.warning*`` section),
  when using these attributes the problem is diagnosed
  earlier and with exact location of the call even in presence of inline
  functions or when not emitting debugging information.

.. index:: externally_visible function attribute

.. fn-attr:: externally_visible

  This attribute, attached to a global variable or function, nullifies
  the effect of the :option:`-fwhole-program` command-line option, so the
  object remains visible outside the current compilation unit.

  If :option:`-fwhole-program` is used together with :option:`-flto` and
  :command:`gold` is used as the linker plugin,
  :fn-attr:`externally_visible` attributes are automatically added to functions
  (not variable yet due to a current :command:`gold` issue)
  that are accessed outside of LTO objects according to resolution file
  produced by :command:`gold`.
  For other linkers that cannot generate resolution file,
  explicit :fn-attr:`externally_visible` attributes are still necessary.

.. index:: fd_arg function attribute

.. fn-attr:: fd_arg, fd_arg (N)

  The :fn-attr:`fd_arg` attribute may be applied to a function that takes an open
  file descriptor at referenced argument :samp:`{N}`.

  It indicates that the passed filedescriptor must not have been closed.
  Therefore, when the analyzer is enabled with :option:`-fanalyzer`, the
  analyzer may emit a :option:`-Wanalyzer-fd-use-after-close` diagnostic
  if it detects a code path in which a function with this attribute is
  called with a closed file descriptor.

  The attribute also indicates that the file descriptor must have been checked for
  validity before usage. Therefore, analyzer may emit
  :option:`-Wanalyzer-fd-use-without-check` diagnostic if it detects a code path in
  which a function with this attribute is called with a file descriptor that has
  not been checked for validity.

.. index:: fd_arg_read function attribute

.. fn-attr:: fd_arg_read, fd_arg_read (N)

  The :fn-attr:`fd_arg_read` is identical to :fn-attr:`fd_arg`, but with the additional
  requirement that it might read from the file descriptor, and thus, the file
  descriptor must not have been opened as write-only.

  The analyzer may emit a :option:`-Wanalyzer-access-mode-mismatch`
  diagnostic if it detects a code path in which a function with this
  attribute is called on a file descriptor opened with ``O_WRONLY``.

.. index:: fd_arg_write function attribute

.. fn-attr:: fd_arg_write, fd_arg_write (N)

  The :fn-attr:`fd_arg_write` is identical to :fn-attr:`fd_arg_read` except that the
  analyzer may emit a :option:`-Wanalyzer-access-mode-mismatch` diagnostic if
  it detects a code path in which a function with this attribute is called on a
  file descriptor opened with ``O_RDONLY``.

.. index:: flatten function attribute

.. fn-attr:: flatten

  Generally, inlining into a function is limited.  For a function marked with
  this attribute, every call inside this function is inlined, if possible.
  Functions declared with attribute :fn-attr:`noinline` and similar are not
  inlined.  Whether the function itself is considered for inlining depends
  on its size and the current inlining parameters.

.. index:: format function attribute, functions with printf, scanf, strftime or strfmon style arguments

.. option:: format (archetype, string-index, first-to-check)

  The ``format`` attribute specifies that a function takes ``printf``,
  ``scanf``, ``strftime`` or ``strfmon`` style arguments that
  should be type-checked against a format string.  For example, the
  declaration:

  .. code-block:: c++

    extern int
    my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
          __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));

  causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to ``my_printf``
  for consistency with the ``printf`` style format string argument
  ``my_format``.

  The parameter :samp:`{archetype}` determines how the format string is
  interpreted, and should be ``printf``, ``scanf``, ``strftime``,
  ``gnu_printf``, ``gnu_scanf``, ``gnu_strftime`` or
  ``strfmon``.  (You can also use ``__printf__``,
  ``__scanf__``, ``__strftime__`` or ``__strfmon__``.)  On
  MinGW targets, ``ms_printf``, ``ms_scanf``, and
  ``ms_strftime`` are also present.
  :samp:`{archetype}` values such as ``printf`` refer to the formats accepted
  by the system's C runtime library,
  while values prefixed with :samp:`gnu_` always refer
  to the formats accepted by the GNU C Library.  On Microsoft Windows
  targets, values prefixed with :samp:`ms_` refer to the formats accepted by the
  :samp:`msvcrt.dll` library.
  The parameter :samp:`{string-index}`
  specifies which argument is the format string argument (starting
  from 1), while :samp:`{first-to-check}` is the number of the first
  argument to check against the format string.  For functions
  where the arguments are not available to be checked (such as
  ``vprintf``), specify the third parameter as zero.  In this case the
  compiler only checks the format string for consistency.  For
  ``strftime`` formats, the third parameter is required to be zero.
  Since non-static C++ methods have an implicit ``this`` argument, the
  arguments of such methods should be counted from two, not one, when
  giving values for :samp:`{string-index}` and :samp:`{first-to-check}`.

  In the example above, the format string (``my_format``) is the second
  argument of the function ``my_print``, and the arguments to check
  start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the format
  attribute are 2 and 3.

  The ``format`` attribute allows you to identify your own functions
  that take format strings as arguments, so that GCC can check the
  calls to these functions for errors.  The compiler always (unless
  :option:`-ffreestanding` or :option:`-fno-builtin` is used) checks formats
  for the standard library functions ``printf``, ``fprintf``,
  ``sprintf``, ``scanf``, ``fscanf``, ``sscanf``, ``strftime``,
  ``vprintf``, ``vfprintf`` and ``vsprintf`` whenever such
  warnings are requested (using :option:`-Wformat`), so there is no need to
  modify the header file :samp:`stdio.h`.  In C99 mode, the functions
  ``snprintf``, ``vsnprintf``, ``vscanf``, ``vfscanf`` and
  ``vsscanf`` are also checked.  Except in strictly conforming C
  standard modes, the X/Open function ``strfmon`` is also checked as
  are ``printf_unlocked`` and ``fprintf_unlocked``.
  See :ref:`c-dialect-options`.

  For Objective-C dialects, ``NSString`` (or ``__NSString__``) is
  recognized in the same context.  Declarations including these format attributes
  are parsed for correct syntax, however the result of checking of such format
  strings is not yet defined, and is not carried out by this version of the
  compiler.

  The target may also provide additional types of format checks.
  See :ref:`target-format-checks`.

.. index:: format_arg function attribute

.. option:: format_arg (string-index)

  The ``format_arg`` attribute specifies that a function takes one or
  more format strings for a ``printf``, ``scanf``, ``strftime`` or
  ``strfmon`` style function and modifies it (for example, to translate
  it into another language), so the result can be passed to a
  ``printf``, ``scanf``, ``strftime`` or ``strfmon`` style
  function (with the remaining arguments to the format function the same
  as they would have been for the unmodified string).  Multiple
  ``format_arg`` attributes may be applied to the same function, each
  designating a distinct parameter as a format string.  For example, the
  declaration:

  .. code-block:: c++

    extern char *
    my_dgettext (char *my_domain, const char *my_format)
          __attribute__ ((format_arg (2)));

  causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to a ``printf``,
  ``scanf``, ``strftime`` or ``strfmon`` type function, whose
  format string argument is a call to the ``my_dgettext`` function, for
  consistency with the format string argument ``my_format``.  If the
  ``format_arg`` attribute had not been specified, all the compiler
  could tell in such calls to format functions would be that the format
  string argument is not constant; this would generate a warning when
  :option:`-Wformat-nonliteral` is used, but the calls could not be checked
  without the attribute.

  In calls to a function declared with more than one ``format_arg``
  attribute, each with a distinct argument value, the corresponding
  actual function arguments are checked against all format strings
  designated by the attributes.  This capability is designed to support
  the GNU ``ngettext`` family of functions.

  The parameter :samp:`{string-index}` specifies which argument is the format
  string argument (starting from one).  Since non-static C++ methods have
  an implicit ``this`` argument, the arguments of such methods should
  be counted from two.

  The ``format_arg`` attribute allows you to identify your own
  functions that modify format strings, so that GCC can check the
  calls to ``printf``, ``scanf``, ``strftime`` or ``strfmon``
  type function whose operands are a call to one of your own function.
  The compiler always treats ``gettext``, ``dgettext``, and
  ``dcgettext`` in this manner except when strict ISO C support is
  requested by :option:`-ansi` or an appropriate :option:`-std` option, or
  :option:`-ffreestanding` or :option:`-fno-builtin`
  is used.  See :ref:`c-dialect-options`.

  For Objective-C dialects, the ``format-arg`` attribute may refer to an
  ``NSString`` reference for compatibility with the ``format`` attribute
  above.

  The target may also allow additional types in ``format-arg`` attributes.
  See :ref:`target-format-checks`.

.. index:: gnu_inline function attribute

.. fn-attr:: gnu_inline

  This attribute should be used with a function that is also declared
  with the ``inline`` keyword.  It directs GCC to treat the function
  as if it were defined in gnu90 mode even when compiling in C99 or
  gnu99 mode.

  If the function is declared ``extern``, then this definition of the
  function is used only for inlining.  In no case is the function
  compiled as a standalone function, not even if you take its address
  explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as if you
  had only declared the function, and had not defined it.  This has
  almost the effect of a macro.  The way to use this is to put a
  function definition in a header file with this attribute, and put
  another copy of the function, without ``extern``, in a library
  file.  The definition in the header file causes most calls to the
  function to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they
  refer to the single copy in the library.  Note that the two
  definitions of the functions need not be precisely the same, although
  if they do not have the same effect your program may behave oddly.

  In C, if the function is neither ``extern`` nor ``static``, then
  the function is compiled as a standalone function, as well as being
  inlined where possible.

  This is how GCC traditionally handled functions declared
  ``inline``.  Since ISO C99 specifies a different semantics for
  ``inline``, this function attribute is provided as a transition
  measure and as a useful feature in its own right.  This attribute is
  available in GCC 4.1.3 and later.  It is available if either of the
  preprocessor macros ``__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__`` or
  ``__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__`` are defined.  See :ref:`inline`.

  In C++, this attribute does not depend on ``extern`` in any way,
  but it still requires the ``inline`` keyword to enable its special
  behavior.

.. index:: hot function attribute

.. fn-attr:: hot

  The :fn-attr:`hot` attribute on a function is used to inform the compiler that
  the function is a hot spot of the compiled program.  The function is
  optimized more aggressively and on many targets it is placed into a special
  subsection of the text section so all hot functions appear close together,
  improving locality.

  When profile feedback is available, via :option:`-fprofile-use`, hot functions
  are automatically detected and this attribute is ignored.

.. index:: ifunc function attribute, indirect functions, functions that are dynamically resolved

.. fn-attr:: ifunc ("resolver")

  The ``ifunc`` attribute is used to mark a function as an indirect
  function using the STT_GNU_IFUNC symbol type extension to the ELF
  standard.  This allows the resolution of the symbol value to be
  determined dynamically at load time, and an optimized version of the
  routine to be selected for the particular processor or other system
  characteristics determined then.  To use this attribute, first define
  the implementation functions available, and a resolver function that
  returns a pointer to the selected implementation function.  The
  implementation functions' declarations must match the API of the
  function being implemented.  The resolver should be declared to
  be a function taking no arguments and returning a pointer to
  a function of the same type as the implementation.  For example:

  .. code-block:: c++

    void *my_memcpy (void *dst, const void *src, size_t len)
    {
      ...
      return dst;
    }

    static void * (*resolve_memcpy (void))(void *, const void *, size_t)
    {
      return my_memcpy; // we will just always select this routine
    }

  The exported header file declaring the function the user calls would
  contain:

  .. code-block:: c++

    extern void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t);

  allowing the user to call ``memcpy`` as a regular function, unaware of
  the actual implementation.  Finally, the indirect function needs to be
  defined in the same translation unit as the resolver function:

  .. code-block:: c++

    void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t)
         __attribute__ ((ifunc ("resolve_memcpy")));

  In C++, the ``ifunc`` attribute takes a string that is the mangled name
  of the resolver function.  A C++ resolver for a non-static member function
  of class ``C`` should be declared to return a pointer to a non-member
  function taking pointer to ``C`` as the first argument, followed by
  the same arguments as of the implementation function.  G++ checks
  the signatures of the two functions and issues
  a :option:`-Wattribute-alias` warning for mismatches.  To suppress a warning
  for the necessary cast from a pointer to the implementation member function
  to the type of the corresponding non-member function use
  the :option:`-Wno-pmf-conversions` option.  For example:

  .. code-block:: c++

    class S
    {
    private:
      int debug_impl (int);
      int optimized_impl (int);

      typedef int Func (S*, int);

      static Func* resolver ();
    public:

      int interface (int);
    };

    int S::debug_impl (int) { /* ... */ }
    int S::optimized_impl (int) { /* ... */ }

    S::Func* S::resolver ()
    {
      int (S::*pimpl) (int)
        = getenv ("DEBUG") ? &S::debug_impl : &S::optimized_impl;

      // Cast triggers -Wno-pmf-conversions.
      return reinterpret_cast<Func*>(pimpl);
    }

    int S::interface (int) __attribute__ ((ifunc ("_ZN1S8resolverEv")));

  Indirect functions cannot be weak.  Binutils version 2.20.1 or higher
  and GNU C Library version 2.11.1 are required to use this feature.

.. fn-attr:: interrupt, interrupt_handler

  Many GCC back ends support attributes to indicate that a function is
  an interrupt handler, which tells the compiler to generate function
  entry and exit sequences that differ from those from regular
  functions.  The exact syntax and behavior are target-specific;
  refer to the following subsections for details.

.. index:: leaf function attribute

.. fn-attr:: leaf

  Calls to external functions with this attribute must return to the
  current compilation unit only by return or by exception handling.  In
  particular, a leaf function is not allowed to invoke callback functions
  passed to it from the current compilation unit, directly call functions
  exported by the unit, or ``longjmp`` into the unit.  Leaf functions
  might still call functions from other compilation units and thus they
  are not necessarily leaf in the sense that they contain no function
  calls at all.

  The attribute is intended for library functions to improve dataflow
  analysis.  The compiler takes the hint that any data not escaping the
  current compilation unit cannot be used or modified by the leaf
  function.  For example, the ``sin`` function is a leaf function, but
  ``qsort`` is not.

  Note that leaf functions might indirectly run a signal handler defined
  in the current compilation unit that uses static variables.  Similarly,
  when lazy symbol resolution is in effect, leaf functions might invoke
  indirect functions whose resolver function or implementation function is
  defined in the current compilation unit and uses static variables.  There
  is no standard-compliant way to write such a signal handler, resolver
  function, or implementation function, and the best that you can do is to
  remove the :fn-attr:`leaf` attribute or mark all such static variables
  ``volatile``.  Lastly, for ELF-based systems that support symbol
  interposition, care should be taken that functions defined in the
  current compilation unit do not unexpectedly interpose other symbols
  based on the defined standards mode and defined feature test macros;
  otherwise an inadvertent callback would be added.

  The attribute has no effect on functions defined within the current
  compilation unit.  This is to allow easy merging of multiple compilation
  units into one, for example, by using the link-time optimization.  For
  this reason the attribute is not allowed on types to annotate indirect
  calls.

.. index:: malloc function attribute, functions that behave like malloc

.. fn-attr:: malloc, malloc (deallocator), malloc (deallocator, ptr-index)

  Attribute ``malloc`` indicates that a function is ``malloc`` -like,
  i.e., that the pointer :samp:`{P}` returned by the function cannot alias any
  other pointer valid when the function returns, and moreover no
  pointers to valid objects occur in any storage addressed by :samp:`{P}`. In
  addition, the GCC predicts that a function with the attribute returns
  non-null in most cases.

  Independently, the form of the attribute with one or two arguments
  associates ``deallocator`` as a suitable deallocation function for
  pointers returned from the ``malloc`` -like function.  :samp:`{ptr-index}`
  denotes the positional argument to which when the pointer is passed in
  calls to ``deallocator`` has the effect of deallocating it.

  Using the attribute with no arguments is designed to improve optimization
  by relying on the aliasing property it implies.  Functions like ``malloc``
  and ``calloc`` have this property because they return a pointer to
  uninitialized or zeroed-out, newly obtained storage.  However, functions
  like ``realloc`` do not have this property, as they may return pointers
  to storage containing pointers to existing objects.  Additionally, since
  all such functions are assumed to return null only infrequently, callers
  can be optimized based on that assumption.

  Associating a function with a :samp:`{deallocator}` helps detect calls to
  mismatched allocation and deallocation functions and diagnose them under
  the control of options such as :option:`-Wmismatched-dealloc`.  It also
  makes it possible to diagnose attempts to deallocate objects that were not
  allocated dynamically, by :option:`-Wfree-nonheap-object`.  To indicate
  that an allocation function both satisifies the nonaliasing property and
  has a deallocator associated with it, both the plain form of the attribute
  and the one with the :samp:`{deallocator}` argument must be used.  The same
  function can be both an allocator and a deallocator.  Since inlining one
  of the associated functions but not the other could result in apparent
  mismatches, this form of attribute ``malloc`` is not accepted on inline
  functions.  For the same reason, using the attribute prevents both
  the allocation and deallocation functions from being expanded inline.

  For example, besides stating that the functions return pointers that do
  not alias any others, the following declarations make ``fclose``
  a suitable deallocator for pointers returned from all functions except
  ``popen``, and ``pclose`` as the only suitable deallocator for
  pointers returned from ``popen``.  The deallocator functions must
  be declared before they can be referenced in the attribute.

  .. code-block:: c++

    int fclose (FILE*);
    int pclose (FILE*);

    __attribute__ ((malloc, malloc (fclose, 1)))
      FILE* fdopen (int, const char*);
    __attribute__ ((malloc, malloc (fclose, 1)))
      FILE* fopen (const char*, const char*);
    __attribute__ ((malloc, malloc (fclose, 1)))
      FILE* fmemopen(void *, size_t, const char *);
    __attribute__ ((malloc, malloc (pclose, 1)))
      FILE* popen (const char*, const char*);
    __attribute__ ((malloc, malloc (fclose, 1)))
      FILE* tmpfile (void);

  The warnings guarded by :option:`-fanalyzer` respect allocation and
  deallocation pairs marked with the ``malloc``.  In particular:

  * The analyzer will emit a :option:`-Wanalyzer-mismatching-deallocation`
    diagnostic if there is an execution path in which the result of an
    allocation call is passed to a different deallocator.

  * The analyzer will emit a :option:`-Wanalyzer-double-free`
    diagnostic if there is an execution path in which a value is passed
    more than once to a deallocation call.

  * The analyzer will consider the possibility that an allocation function
    could fail and return NULL.  It will emit
    :option:`-Wanalyzer-possible-null-dereference` and
    :option:`-Wanalyzer-possible-null-argument` diagnostics if there are
    execution paths in which an unchecked result of an allocation call is
    dereferenced or passed to a function requiring a non-null argument.
    If the allocator always returns non-null, use
    ``__attribute__ ((returns_nonnull))`` to suppress these warnings.
    For example:

    .. code-block:: c++

      char *xstrdup (const char *)
        __attribute__((malloc (free), returns_nonnull));

  * The analyzer will emit a :option:`-Wanalyzer-use-after-free`
    diagnostic if there is an execution path in which the memory passed
    by pointer to a deallocation call is used after the deallocation.

  * The analyzer will emit a :option:`-Wanalyzer-malloc-leak` diagnostic if
    there is an execution path in which the result of an allocation call
    is leaked (without being passed to the deallocation function).

  * The analyzer will emit a :option:`-Wanalyzer-free-of-non-heap` diagnostic
    if a deallocation function is used on a global or on-stack variable.

  The analyzer assumes that deallocators can gracefully handle the ``NULL``
  pointer.  If this is not the case, the deallocator can be marked with
  ``__attribute__((nonnull))`` so that :option:`-fanalyzer` can emit
  a :option:`-Wanalyzer-possible-null-argument` diagnostic for code paths
  in which the deallocator is called with NULL.

.. index:: no_icf function attribute

.. fn-attr:: no_icf

  This function attribute prevents a functions from being merged with another
  semantically equivalent function.

.. index:: no_instrument_function function attribute

.. option:: no_instrument_function

  If any of :option:`-finstrument-functions`, :option:`-p`, or :option:`-pg` are
  given, profiling function calls are
  generated at entry and exit of most user-compiled functions.
  Functions with this attribute are not so instrumented.

.. index:: no_profile_instrument_function function attribute

.. fn-attr:: no_profile_instrument_function

  The :fn-attr:`no_profile_instrument_function` attribute on functions is used
  to inform the compiler that it should not process any profile feedback based
  optimization code instrumentation.

.. index:: no_reorder function attribute

.. fn-attr:: no_reorder

  Do not reorder functions or variables marked :fn-attr:`no_reorder`
  against each other or top level assembler statements the executable.
  The actual order in the program will depend on the linker command
  line. Static variables marked like this are also not removed.
  This has a similar effect
  as the :option:`-fno-toplevel-reorder` option, but only applies to the
  marked symbols.

.. index:: no_sanitize function attribute

.. fn-attr:: no_sanitize ("sanitize_option")

  The ``no_sanitize`` attribute on functions is used
  to inform the compiler that it should not do sanitization of any option
  mentioned in :samp:`{sanitize_option}`.  A list of values acceptable by
  the :option:`-fsanitize` option can be provided.

  .. code-block:: c++

    void __attribute__ ((no_sanitize ("alignment", "object-size")))
    f () { /* Do something. */; }
    void __attribute__ ((no_sanitize ("alignment,object-size")))
    g () { /* Do something. */; }

.. index:: no_sanitize_address function attribute

.. fn-attr:: no_sanitize_address, no_address_safety_analysis

  The :fn-attr:`no_sanitize_address` attribute on functions is used
  to inform the compiler that it should not instrument memory accesses
  in the function when compiling with the :option:`-fsanitize=address` option.
  The ``no_address_safety_analysis`` is a deprecated alias of the
  :fn-attr:`no_sanitize_address` attribute, new code should use
  :fn-attr:`no_sanitize_address`.

.. index:: no_sanitize_thread function attribute

.. fn-attr:: no_sanitize_thread

  The :fn-attr:`no_sanitize_thread` attribute on functions is used
  to inform the compiler that it should not instrument memory accesses
  in the function when compiling with the :option:`-fsanitize=thread` option.

.. index:: no_sanitize_undefined function attribute

.. fn-attr:: no_sanitize_undefined

  The :fn-attr:`no_sanitize_undefined` attribute on functions is used
  to inform the compiler that it should not check for undefined behavior
  in the function when compiling with the :option:`-fsanitize=undefined` option.

.. index:: no_sanitize_coverage function attribute

.. fn-attr:: no_sanitize_coverage

  The :fn-attr:`no_sanitize_coverage` attribute on functions is used
  to inform the compiler that it should not do coverage-guided
  fuzzing code instrumentation (:option:`-fsanitize-coverage`).

.. index:: no_split_stack function attribute

.. option:: no_split_stack

  If :option:`-fsplit-stack` is given, functions have a small
  prologue which decides whether to split the stack.  Functions with the
  ``no_split_stack`` attribute do not have that prologue, and thus
  may run with only a small amount of stack space available.

.. index:: no_stack_limit function attribute

.. fn-attr:: no_stack_limit

  This attribute locally overrides the :option:`-fstack-limit-register`
  and :option:`-fstack-limit-symbol` command-line options; it has the effect
  of disabling stack limit checking in the function it applies to.

.. index:: noclone function attribute

.. fn-attr:: noclone

  This function attribute prevents a function from being considered for
  cloning---a mechanism that produces specialized copies of functions
  and which is (currently) performed by interprocedural constant
  propagation.

.. index:: noinline function attribute

.. fn-attr:: noinline

  This function attribute prevents a function from being considered for
  inlining.

  .. Don't enumerate the optimizations by name here; we try to be

  .. future-compatible with this mechanism.

  If the function does not have side effects, there are optimizations
  other than inlining that cause function calls to be optimized away,
  although the function call is live.  To keep such calls from being
  optimized away, put

  .. code-block:: c++

    asm ("");

  (see :ref:`extended-asm`) in the called function, to serve as a special
  side effect.

.. index:: noipa function attribute

.. fn-attr:: noipa

  Disable interprocedural optimizations between the function with this
  attribute and its callers, as if the body of the function is not available
  when optimizing callers and the callers are unavailable when optimizing
  the body.  This attribute implies :fn-attr:`noinline`, :fn-attr:`noclone` and
  :fn-attr:`no_icf` attributes.    However, this attribute is not equivalent
  to a combination of other attributes, because its purpose is to suppress
  existing and future optimizations employing interprocedural analysis,
  including those that do not have an attribute suitable for disabling
  them individually.  This attribute is supported mainly for the purpose
  of testing the compiler.

.. index:: nonnull function attribute, functions with non-null pointer arguments

.. fn-attr:: nonnull, nonnull (arg-index, ...)

  The :fn-attr:`nonnull` attribute may be applied to a function that takes at
  least one argument of a pointer type.  It indicates that the referenced
  arguments must be non-null pointers.  For instance, the declaration:

  .. code-block:: c++

    extern void *
    my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
            __attribute__((nonnull (1, 2)));

  informs the compiler that, in calls to ``my_memcpy``, arguments
  :samp:`{dest}` and :samp:`{src}` must be non-null.

  The attribute has an effect both on functions calls and function definitions.

  For function calls:

  * If the compiler determines that a null pointer is
    passed in an argument slot marked as non-null, and the
    :option:`-Wnonnull` option is enabled, a warning is issued.
    See :ref:`warning-options`.

  * The :option:`-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute` option can be
    specified to have GCC transform calls with null arguments to non-null
    functions into traps.  See :ref:`optimize-options`.

  * The compiler may also perform optimizations based on the
    knowledge that certain function arguments cannot be null.  These
    optimizations can be disabled by the
    :option:`-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` option. See :ref:`optimize-options`.

  For function definitions:

  * If the compiler determines that a function parameter that is
    marked with nonnull is compared with null, and
    :option:`-Wnonnull-compare` option is enabled, a warning is issued.
    See :ref:`warning-options`.

  * The compiler may also perform optimizations based on the
    knowledge that ``nonnul`` parameters cannot be null.  This can
    currently not be disabled other than by removing the nonnull
    attribute.

  If no :samp:`{arg-index}` is given to the :fn-attr:`nonnull` attribute,
  all pointer arguments are marked as non-null.  To illustrate, the
  following declaration is equivalent to the previous example:

  .. code-block:: c++

    extern void *
    my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
            __attribute__((nonnull));

.. index:: noplt function attribute

.. fn-attr:: noplt

  The :fn-attr:`noplt` attribute is the counterpart to option :option:`-fno-plt`.
  Calls to functions marked with this attribute in position-independent code
  do not use the PLT.

  .. code-block:: c++

    /* Externally defined function foo.  */
    int foo () __attribute__ ((noplt));

    int
    main (/* ... */)
    {
      /* ... */
      foo ();
      /* ... */
    }

  The :fn-attr:`noplt` attribute on function ``foo``
  tells the compiler to assume that
  the function ``foo`` is externally defined and that the call to
  ``foo`` must avoid the PLT
  in position-independent code.

  In position-dependent code, a few targets also convert calls to
  functions that are marked to not use the PLT to use the GOT instead.

.. index:: noreturn function attribute, functions that never return

.. fn-attr:: noreturn

  A few standard library functions, such as ``abort`` and ``exit``,
  cannot return.  GCC knows this automatically.  Some programs define
  their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
  :fn-attr:`noreturn` to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,

  .. code-block:: c++

    void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));

    void
    fatal (/* ... */)
    {
      /* ... */ /* Print error message. */ /* ... */
      exit (1);
    }

  The :fn-attr:`noreturn` keyword tells the compiler to assume that
  ``fatal`` cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what
  would happen if ``fatal`` ever did return.  This makes slightly
  better code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
  uninitialized variables.

  The :fn-attr:`noreturn` keyword does not affect the exceptional path when that
  applies: a :fn-attr:`noreturn` -marked function may still return to the caller
  by throwing an exception or calling ``longjmp``.

  In order to preserve backtraces, GCC will never turn calls to
  :fn-attr:`noreturn` functions into tail calls.

  Do not assume that registers saved by the calling function are
  restored before calling the :fn-attr:`noreturn` function.

  It does not make sense for a :fn-attr:`noreturn` function to have a return
  type other than ``void``.

.. index:: nothrow function attribute

.. fn-attr:: nothrow

  The :fn-attr:`nothrow` attribute is used to inform the compiler that a
  function cannot throw an exception.  For example, most functions in
  the standard C library can be guaranteed not to throw an exception
  with the notable exceptions of ``qsort`` and ``bsearch`` that
  take function pointer arguments.

.. index:: optimize function attribute

.. fn-attr:: optimize (level, ...), optimize (string, ...)

.. fn-attr:: optimize (string, ...)

  The ``optimize`` attribute is used to specify that a function is to
  be compiled with different optimization options than specified on the
  command line.  The optimize attribute arguments of a function behave
  behave as if appended to the command-line.

  Valid arguments are constant non-negative integers and
  strings.  Each numeric argument specifies an optimization :samp:`{level}`.
  Each :samp:`{string}` argument consists of one or more comma-separated
  substrings.  Each substring that begins with the letter ``O`` refers
  to an optimization option such as :option:`-O0` or :option:`-Os`.  Other
  substrings are taken as suffixes to the ``-f`` prefix jointly
  forming the name of an optimization option.  See :ref:`optimize-options`.

  :samp:`#pragma GCC optimize` can be used to set optimization options
  for more than one function.  See :ref:`function-specific-option-pragmas`,
  for details about the pragma.

  Providing multiple strings as arguments separated by commas to specify
  multiple options is equivalent to separating the option suffixes with
  a comma (:samp:`,`) within a single string.  Spaces are not permitted
  within the strings.

  Not every optimization option that starts with the :samp:`{-f}` prefix
  specified by the attribute necessarily has an effect on the function.
  The ``optimize`` attribute should be used for debugging purposes only.
  It is not suitable in production code.

.. index:: patchable_function_entry function attribute, extra NOP instructions at the function entry point

.. fn-attr:: patchable_function_entry

  In case the target's text segment can be made writable at run time by
  any means, padding the function entry with a number of NOPs can be
  used to provide a universal tool for instrumentation.

  The :fn-attr:`patchable_function_entry` function attribute can be used to
  change the number of NOPs to any desired value.  The two-value syntax
  is the same as for the command-line switch
  :option:`-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M`, generating :samp:`{N}` NOPs, with
  the function entry point before the :samp:`{M}` th NOP instruction.
  :samp:`{M}` defaults to 0 if omitted e.g. function entry point is before
  the first NOP.

  If patchable function entries are enabled globally using the command-line
  option :option:`-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M`, then you must disable
  instrumentation on all functions that are part of the instrumentation
  framework with the attribute ``patchable_function_entry (0)``
  to prevent recursion.

.. index:: pure function attribute, functions that have no side effects

.. fn-attr:: pure

  Calls to functions that have no observable effects on the state of
  the program other than to return a value may lend themselves to optimizations
  such as common subexpression elimination.  Declaring such functions with
  the :fn-attr:`pure` attribute allows GCC to avoid emitting some calls in repeated
  invocations of the function with the same argument values.

  The :fn-attr:`pure` attribute prohibits a function from modifying the state
  of the program that is observable by means other than inspecting
  the function's return value.  However, functions declared with the :fn-attr:`pure`
  attribute can safely read any non-volatile objects, and modify the value of
  objects in a way that does not affect their return value or the observable
  state of the program.

  For example,

  .. code-block:: c++

    int hash (char *) __attribute__ ((pure));

  tells GCC that subsequent calls to the function ``hash`` with the same
  string can be replaced by the result of the first call provided the state
  of the program observable by ``hash``, including the contents of the array
  itself, does not change in between.  Even though ``hash`` takes a non-const
  pointer argument it must not modify the array it points to, or any other object
  whose value the rest of the program may depend on.  However, the caller may
  safely change the contents of the array between successive calls to
  the function (doing so disables the optimization).  The restriction also
  applies to member objects referenced by the ``this`` pointer in C++
  non-static member functions.

  Some common examples of pure functions are ``strlen`` or ``memcmp``.
  Interesting non-pure functions are functions with infinite loops or those
  depending on volatile memory or other system resource, that may change between
  consecutive calls (such as the standard C ``feof`` function in
  a multithreading environment).

  The :fn-attr:`pure` attribute imposes similar but looser restrictions on
  a function's definition than the :fn-attr:`const` attribute: :fn-attr:`pure`
  allows the function to read any non-volatile memory, even if it changes
  in between successive invocations of the function.  Declaring the same
  function with both the :fn-attr:`pure` and the :fn-attr:`const` attribute is
  diagnosed.  Because a pure function cannot have any observable side
  effects it does not make sense for such a function to return ``void``.
  Declaring such a function is diagnosed.

.. index:: returns_nonnull function attribute

.. fn-attr:: returns_nonnull

  The :fn-attr:`returns_nonnull` attribute specifies that the function
  return value should be a non-null pointer.  For instance, the declaration:

  .. code-block:: c++

    extern void *
    mymalloc (size_t len) __attribute__((returns_nonnull));

  lets the compiler optimize callers based on the knowledge
  that the return value will never be null.

.. index:: returns_twice function attribute, functions that return more than once

.. fn-attr:: returns_twice

  The :fn-attr:`returns_twice` attribute tells the compiler that a function may
  return more than one time.  The compiler ensures that all registers
  are dead before calling such a function and emits a warning about
  the variables that may be clobbered after the second return from the
  function.  Examples of such functions are ``setjmp`` and ``vfork``.
  The ``longjmp`` -like counterpart of such function, if any, might need
  to be marked with the :fn-attr:`noreturn` attribute.

.. index:: section function attribute, functions in arbitrary sections

.. fn-attr:: section ("section-name")

  Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the ``text`` section.
  Sometimes, however, you need additional sections, or you need certain
  particular functions to appear in special sections.  The ``section``
  attribute specifies that a function lives in a particular section.
  For example, the declaration:

  .. code-block:: c++

    extern void foobar (void) __attribute__ ((section ("bar")));

  puts the function ``foobar`` in the ``bar`` section.

  Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the ``section``
  attribute is not available on all platforms.
  If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
  section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

.. index:: sentinel function attribute

.. fn-attr:: sentinel, sentinel (position)

  This function attribute indicates that an argument in a call to the function
  is expected to be an explicit ``NULL``.  The attribute is only valid on
  variadic functions.  By default, the sentinel is expected to be the last
  argument of the function call.  If the optional :samp:`{position}` argument
  is specified to the attribute, the sentinel must be located at
  :samp:`{position}` counting backwards from the end of the argument list.

  .. code-block:: c++

    __attribute__ ((sentinel))
    is equivalent to
    __attribute__ ((sentinel(0)))

  The attribute is automatically set with a position of 0 for the built-in
  functions ``execl`` and ``execlp``.  The built-in function
  ``execle`` has the attribute set with a position of 1.

  A valid ``NULL`` in this context is defined as zero with any object
  pointer type.  If your system defines the ``NULL`` macro with
  an integer type then you need to add an explicit cast.  During
  installation GCC replaces the system ``<stddef.h>`` header with
  a copy that redefines NULL appropriately.

  The warnings for missing or incorrect sentinels are enabled with
  :option:`-Wformat`.

.. index:: simd function attribute

.. fn-attr:: simd, simd("mask")

  This attribute enables creation of one or more function versions that
  can process multiple arguments using SIMD instructions from a
  single invocation.  Specifying this attribute allows compiler to
  assume that such versions are available at link time (provided
  in the same or another translation unit).  Generated versions are
  target-dependent and described in the corresponding Vector ABI document.  For
  x86_64 target this document can be found
  `here <https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/libmvec?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=VectorABI.txt>`_.

  The optional argument :samp:`{mask}` may have the value
  ``notinbranch`` or ``inbranch``,
  and instructs the compiler to generate non-masked or masked
  clones correspondingly. By default, all clones are generated.

  If the attribute is specified and ``#pragma omp declare simd`` is
  present on a declaration and the :option:`-fopenmp` or :option:`-fopenmp-simd`
  switch is specified, then the attribute is ignored.

.. index:: stack_protect function attribute

.. fn-attr:: stack_protect

  This attribute adds stack protection code to the function if
  flags :option:`-fstack-protector`, :option:`-fstack-protector-strong`
  or :option:`-fstack-protector-explicit` are set.

.. index:: no_stack_protector function attribute

.. fn-attr:: no_stack_protector

  This attribute prevents stack protection code for the function.

.. index:: target function attribute

.. fn-attr:: target (string, ...)

  Multiple target back ends implement the ``target`` attribute
  to specify that a function is to
  be compiled with different target options than specified on the
  command line.  The original target command-line options are ignored.
  One or more strings can be provided as arguments.
  Each string consists of one or more comma-separated suffixes to
  the ``-m`` prefix jointly forming the name of a machine-dependent
  option.  See :ref:`submodel-options`.

  The ``target`` attribute can be used for instance to have a function
  compiled with a different ISA (instruction set architecture) than the
  default.  :samp:`#pragma GCC target` can be used to specify target-specific
  options for more than one function.  See :ref:`function-specific-option-pragmas`,
  for details about the pragma.

  For instance, on an x86, you could declare one function with the
  ``target("sse4.1,arch=core2")`` attribute and another with
  ``target("sse4a,arch=amdfam10")``.  This is equivalent to
  compiling the first function with :option:`-msse4.1` and
  :option:`-march=core2` options, and the second function with
  :option:`-msse4a` and :option:`-march=amdfam10` options.  It is up to you
  to make sure that a function is only invoked on a machine that
  supports the particular ISA it is compiled for (for example by using
  ``cpuid`` on x86 to determine what feature bits and architecture
  family are used).

  .. code-block:: c++

    int core2_func (void) __attribute__ ((__target__ ("arch=core2")));
    int sse3_func (void) __attribute__ ((__target__ ("sse3")));

  Providing multiple strings as arguments separated by commas to specify
  multiple options is equivalent to separating the option suffixes with
  a comma (:samp:`,`) within a single string.  Spaces are not permitted
  within the strings.

  The options supported are specific to each target; refer to :ref:`x86-function-attributes`, :ref:`powerpc-function-attributes`,
  :ref:`arm-function-attributes`, :ref:`aarch64-function-attributes`,
  :ref:`nios-ii-function-attributes`, and :ref:`s-390-function-attributes`
  for details.

.. index:: symver function attribute

.. fn-attr:: symver ("name2@nodename")

  On ELF targets this attribute creates a symbol version.  The :samp:`{name2}` part
  of the parameter is the actual name of the symbol by which it will be
  externally referenced.  The ``nodename`` portion should be the name of a
  node specified in the version script supplied to the linker when building a
  shared library.  Versioned symbol must be defined and must be exported with
  default visibility.

  .. code-block:: c++

    __attribute__ ((__symver__ ("foo@VERS_1"))) int
    foo_v1 (void)
    {
    }

  Will produce a ``.symver foo_v1, foo@VERS_1`` directive in the assembler
  output.

  One can also define multiple version for a given symbol
  (starting from binutils 2.35).

  .. code-block:: c++

    __attribute__ ((__symver__ ("foo@VERS_2"), __symver__ ("foo@VERS_3")))
    int symver_foo_v1 (void)
    {
    }

  This example creates a symbol name ``symver_foo_v1``
  which will be version ``VERS_2`` and ``VERS_3`` of ``foo``.

  If you have an older release of binutils, then symbol alias needs to
  be used:

  .. code-block:: c++

    __attribute__ ((__symver__ ("foo@VERS_2")))
    int foo_v1 (void)
    {
      return 0;
    }

    __attribute__ ((__symver__ ("foo@VERS_3")))
    __attribute__ ((alias ("foo_v1")))
    int symver_foo_v1 (void);

  Finally if the parameter is ``"name2@@nodename"`` then in
  addition to creating a symbol version (as if
  ``"name2@nodename"`` was used) the version will be also used
  to resolve :samp:`{name2}` by the linker.

.. index:: tainted_args function attribute

.. fn-attr:: tainted_args

  The :fn-attr:`tainted_args` attribute is used to specify that a function is called
  in a way that requires sanitization of its arguments, such as a system
  call in an operating system kernel.  Such a function can be considered part
  of the 'attack surface' of the program.  The attribute can be used both
  on function declarations, and on field declarations containing function
  pointers.  In the latter case, any function used as an initializer of
  such a callback field will be treated as being called with tainted
  arguments.

  The analyzer will pay particular attention to such functions when both
  :option:`-fanalyzer` and :option:`-fanalyzer-checker=taint` are supplied,
  potentially issuing warnings guarded by
  :option:`-Wanalyzer-tainted-allocation-size`,
  :option:`-Wanalyzer-tainted-array-index`,
  :option:`-Wanalyzer-tainted-divisor`,
  :option:`-Wanalyzer-tainted-offset`,
  and :option:`-Wanalyzer-tainted-size`.

.. index:: target_clones function attribute

.. fn-attr:: target_clones (options)

  The ``target_clones`` attribute is used to specify that a function
  be cloned into multiple versions compiled with different target options
  than specified on the command line.  The supported options and restrictions
  are the same as for ``target`` attribute.

  For instance, on an x86, you could compile a function with
  ``target_clones("sse4.1,avx")``.  GCC creates two function clones,
  one compiled with :option:`-msse4.1` and another with :option:`-mavx`.

  On a PowerPC, you can compile a function with
  ``target_clones("cpu=power9,default")``.  GCC will create two
  function clones, one compiled with :option:`-mcpu=power9` and another
  with the default options.  GCC must be configured to use GLIBC 2.23 or
  newer in order to use the ``target_clones`` attribute.

  It also creates a resolver function (see
  the ``ifunc`` attribute above) that dynamically selects a clone
  suitable for current architecture.  The resolver is created only if there
  is a usage of a function with ``target_clones`` attribute.

  Note that any subsequent call of a function without ``target_clone``
  from a ``target_clone`` caller will not lead to copying
  (target clone) of the called function.
  If you want to enforce such behaviour,
  we recommend declaring the calling function with the :fn-attr:`flatten` attribute?

.. index:: unused function attribute

.. fn-attr:: unused

  This attribute, attached to a function, means that the function is meant
  to be possibly unused.  GCC does not produce a warning for this
  function.

.. index:: used function attribute

.. fn-attr:: used

  This attribute, attached to a function, means that code must be emitted
  for the function even if it appears that the function is not referenced.
  This is useful, for example, when the function is referenced only in
  inline assembly.

  When applied to a member function of a C++ class template, the
  attribute also means that the function is instantiated if the
  class itself is instantiated.

.. index:: retain function attribute

.. fn-attr:: retain

  For ELF targets that support the GNU or FreeBSD OSABIs, this attribute
  will save the function from linker garbage collection.  To support
  this behavior, functions that have not been placed in specific sections
  (e.g. by the ``section`` attribute, or the ``-ffunction-sections``
  option), will be placed in new, unique sections.

  This additional functionality requires Binutils version 2.36 or later.

.. index:: visibility function attribute

.. fn-attr:: visibility ("visibility_type")

  This attribute affects the linkage of the declaration to which it is attached.
  It can be applied to variables (see :ref:`common-variable-attributes`) and types
  (see :ref:`common-type-attributes`) as well as functions.

  There are four supported :samp:`{visibility_type}` values: default,
  hidden, protected or internal visibility.

  .. code-block:: c++

    void __attribute__ ((visibility ("protected")))
    f () { /* Do something. */; }
    int i __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")));

  The possible values of :samp:`{visibility_type}` correspond to the
  visibility settings in the ELF gABI.

  .. keep this list of visibilities in alphabetical order.

  ``default``
    Default visibility is the normal case for the object file format.
    This value is available for the visibility attribute to override other
    options that may change the assumed visibility of entities.

    On ELF, default visibility means that the declaration is visible to other
    modules and, in shared libraries, means that the declared entity may be
    overridden.

    On Darwin, default visibility means that the declaration is visible to
    other modules.

    Default visibility corresponds to 'external linkage' in the language.

  ``hidden``
    Hidden visibility indicates that the entity declared has a new
    form of linkage, which we call 'hidden linkage'.  Two
    declarations of an object with hidden linkage refer to the same object
    if they are in the same shared object.

  ``internal``
    Internal visibility is like hidden visibility, but with additional
    processor specific semantics.  Unless otherwise specified by the
    psABI, GCC defines internal visibility to mean that a function is
    *never* called from another module.  Compare this with hidden
    functions which, while they cannot be referenced directly by other
    modules, can be referenced indirectly via function pointers.  By
    indicating that a function cannot be called from outside the module,
    GCC may for instance omit the load of a PIC register since it is known
    that the calling function loaded the correct value.

  ``protected``
    Protected visibility is like default visibility except that it
    indicates that references within the defining module bind to the
    definition in that module.  That is, the declared entity cannot be
    overridden by another module.

  All visibilities are supported on many, but not all, ELF targets
  (supported when the assembler supports the :samp:`.visibility`
  pseudo-op).  Default visibility is supported everywhere.  Hidden
  visibility is supported on Darwin targets.

  The visibility attribute should be applied only to declarations that
  would otherwise have external linkage.  The attribute should be applied
  consistently, so that the same entity should not be declared with
  different settings of the attribute.

  In C++, the visibility attribute applies to types as well as functions
  and objects, because in C++ types have linkage.  A class must not have
  greater visibility than its non-static data member types and bases,
  and class members default to the visibility of their class.  Also, a
  declaration without explicit visibility is limited to the visibility
  of its type.

  In C++, you can mark member functions and static member variables of a
  class with the visibility attribute.  This is useful if you know a
  particular method or static member variable should only be used from
  one shared object; then you can mark it hidden while the rest of the
  class has default visibility.  Care must be taken to avoid breaking
  the One Definition Rule; for example, it is usually not useful to mark
  an inline method as hidden without marking the whole class as hidden.

  A C++ namespace declaration can also have the visibility attribute.

  .. code-block:: c++

    namespace nspace1 __attribute__ ((visibility ("protected")))
    { /* Do something. */; }

  This attribute applies only to the particular namespace body, not to
  other definitions of the same namespace; it is equivalent to using
  :samp:`#pragma GCC visibility` before and after the namespace
  definition (see :ref:`visibility-pragmas`).

  In C++, if a template argument has limited visibility, this
  restriction is implicitly propagated to the template instantiation.
  Otherwise, template instantiations and specializations default to the
  visibility of their template.

  If both the template and enclosing class have explicit visibility, the
  visibility from the template is used.

.. index:: warn_unused_result function attribute

.. fn-attr:: warn_unused_result

  The :fn-attr:`warn_unused_result` attribute causes a warning to be emitted
  if a caller of the function with this attribute does not use its
  return value.  This is useful for functions where not checking
  the result is either a security problem or always a bug, such as
  ``realloc``.

  .. code-block:: c++

    int fn () __attribute__ ((warn_unused_result));
    int foo ()
    {
      if (fn () < 0) return -1;
      fn ();
      return 0;
    }

  results in warning on line 5.

.. index:: weak function attribute

.. fn-attr:: weak

  The :fn-attr:`weak` attribute causes a declaration of an external symbol
  to be emitted as a weak symbol rather than a global.  This is primarily
  useful in defining library functions that can be overridden in user code,
  though it can also be used with non-function declarations.  The overriding
  symbol must have the same type as the weak symbol.  In addition, if it
  designates a variable it must also have the same size and alignment as
  the weak symbol.  Weak symbols are supported for ELF targets, and also
  for a.out targets when using the GNU assembler and linker.

.. index:: weakref function attribute

.. fn-attr:: weakref, weakref ("target")

  The :fn-attr:`weakref` attribute marks a declaration as a weak reference.
  Without arguments, it should be accompanied by an ``alias`` attribute
  naming the target symbol.  Alternatively, :samp:`{target}` may be given as
  an argument to :fn-attr:`weakref` itself, naming the target definition of
  the alias.  The :samp:`{target}` must have the same type as the declaration.
  In addition, if it designates a variable it must also have the same size
  and alignment as the declaration.  In either form of the declaration
  :fn-attr:`weakref` implicitly marks the declared symbol as :fn-attr:`weak`.  Without
  a :samp:`{target}` given as an argument to :fn-attr:`weakref` or to ``alias``,
  :fn-attr:`weakref` is equivalent to :fn-attr:`weak` (in that case the declaration
  may be ``extern``).

  .. code-block:: c++

    /* Given the declaration: */
    extern int y (void);

    /* the following... */
    static int x (void) __attribute__ ((weakref ("y")));

    /* is equivalent to... */
    static int x (void) __attribute__ ((weakref, alias ("y")));

    /* or, alternatively, to... */
    static int x (void) __attribute__ ((weakref));
    static int x (void) __attribute__ ((alias ("y")));

  A weak reference is an alias that does not by itself require a
  definition to be given for the target symbol.  If the target symbol is
  only referenced through weak references, then it becomes a :fn-attr:`weak`
  undefined symbol.  If it is directly referenced, however, then such
  strong references prevail, and a definition is required for the
  symbol, not necessarily in the same translation unit.

  The effect is equivalent to moving all references to the alias to a
  separate translation unit, renaming the alias to the aliased symbol,
  declaring it as weak, compiling the two separate translation units and
  performing a link with relocatable output (i.e. ``ld -r``) on them.

  A declaration to which :fn-attr:`weakref` is attached and that is associated
  with a named ``target`` must be ``static``.

.. index:: zero_call_used_regs function attribute

.. fn-attr:: zero_call_used_regs ("choice")

  The ``zero_call_used_regs`` attribute causes the compiler to zero
  a subset of all call-used registers ([#f1]_) at function return.
  This is used to increase program security by either mitigating
  Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks or preventing information leakage
  through registers.

  In order to satisfy users with different security needs and control the
  run-time overhead at the same time, the :samp:`{choice}` parameter provides a
  flexible way to choose the subset of the call-used registers to be zeroed.
  The three basic values of :samp:`{choice}` are:

  * :samp:`skip` doesn't zero any call-used registers.

  * :samp:`used` only zeros call-used registers that are used in the function.
    A 'used' register is one whose content has been set or referenced in
    the function.

  * :samp:`all` zeros all call-used registers.

  In addition to these three basic choices, it is possible to modify
  :samp:`used` or :samp:`all` as follows:

  * Adding :samp:`-gpr` restricts the zeroing to general-purpose registers.

  * Adding :samp:`-arg` restricts the zeroing to registers that can sometimes
    be used to pass function arguments.  This includes all argument registers
    defined by the platform's calling conversion, regardless of whether the
    function uses those registers for function arguments or not.

  The modifiers can be used individually or together.  If they are used
  together, they must appear in the order above.

  The full list of :samp:`{choice}` s is therefore:

  ``skip``
    doesn't zero any call-used register.

  ``used``
    only zeros call-used registers that are used in the function.

  ``used-gpr``
    only zeros call-used general purpose registers that are used in the function.

  ``used-arg``
    only zeros call-used registers that are used in the function and pass arguments.

  ``used-gpr-arg``
    only zeros call-used general purpose registers that are used in the function
    and pass arguments.

  ``all``
    zeros all call-used registers.

  ``all-gpr``
    zeros all call-used general purpose registers.

  ``all-arg``
    zeros all call-used registers that pass arguments.

  ``all-gpr-arg``
    zeros all call-used general purpose registers that pass
    arguments.

  Of this list, :samp:`used-arg`, :samp:`used-gpr-arg`, :samp:`all-arg`,
  and :samp:`all-gpr-arg` are mainly used for ROP mitigation.

  The default for the attribute is controlled by :option:`-fzero-call-used-regs`.

.. This is the end of the target-independent attribute table

.. [#f1] A 'call-used' register
  is a register whose contents can be changed by a function call;
  therefore, a caller cannot assume that the register has the same contents
  on return from the function as it had before calling the function.  Such
  registers are also called 'call-clobbered', 'caller-saved', or
  'volatile'.

Solaris 2 Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These :samp:`-m` options are supported on Solaris 2:

.. option:: -mclear-hwcap

  :option:`-mclear-hwcap` tells the compiler to remove the hardware
  capabilities generated by the Solaris assembler.  This is only necessary
  when object files use ISA extensions not supported by the current
  machine, but check at runtime whether or not to use them.

.. option:: -mimpure-text

  :option:`-mimpure-text`, used in addition to :option:`-shared`, tells
  the compiler to not pass :option:`-z text` to the linker when linking a
  shared object.  Using this option, you can link position-dependent
  code into a shared object.

  :option:`-mimpure-text` suppresses the 'relocations remain against
  allocatable but non-writable sections' linker error message.
  However, the necessary relocations trigger copy-on-write, and the
  shared object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of
  using :option:`-mimpure-text`, you should compile all source code with
  :option:`-fpic` or :option:`-fPIC`.

These switches are supported in addition to the above on Solaris 2:

.. option:: -pthreads

  This is a synonym for :option:`-pthread`.

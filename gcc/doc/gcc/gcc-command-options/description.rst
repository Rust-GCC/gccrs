Description
***********

When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The 'overall options' allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the :option:`-c` option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
See :ref:`overall-options`.

Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

.. index:: C compilation options

Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.

.. index:: cross compiling, specifying machine version, specifying compiler version and target machine, compiler version, specifying, target machine, specifying

The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called :samp:`gcc`, or
:samp:`{machine}-gcc` when cross-compiling, or
:samp:`{machine}-gcc-{version}` to run a specific version of GCC.
When you compile C++ programs, you should invoke GCC as :samp:`g++`
instead.  See :ref:`invoking-g++`,
for information about the differences in behavior between :samp:`gcc`
and :samp:`g++` when compiling C++ programs.

.. index:: grouping options, options, grouping

The :command:`gcc` program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may *not* be grouped: :option:`-dv` is very different from :samp:`-d
-v`.

.. index:: order of options, options, order

You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify :option:`-L` more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the :option:`-l` option is significant.

Many options have long names starting with :samp:`-f` or with
:samp:`-W`---for example,
:option:`-fmove-loop-invariants`, :option:`-Wformat` and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
:samp:`-ffoo` is :samp:`-fno-foo`.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

Some options take one or more arguments typically separated either
by a space or by the equals sign (:samp:`=`) from the option name.
Unless documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or
a string.  Numeric arguments must typically be small unsigned decimal
or hexadecimal integers.  Hexadecimal arguments must begin with
the :samp:`0x` prefix.  Arguments to options that specify a size
threshold of some sort may be arbitrarily large decimal or hexadecimal
integers followed by a byte size suffix designating a multiple of bytes
such as ``kB`` and ``KiB`` for kilobyte and kibibyte, respectively,
``MB`` and ``MiB`` for megabyte and mebibyte, ``GB`` and
``GiB`` for gigabyte and gigibyte, and so on.  Such arguments are
designated by :samp:`{byte-size}` in the following text.  Refer to the NIST,
IEC, and other relevant national and international standards for the full
listing and explanation of the binary and decimal byte size prefixes.

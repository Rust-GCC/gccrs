;; The Cortex-A15 core is modelled as a triple issue pipeline that has
;; the following dispatch units.
;; 1. Two pipelines for simple integer operations: SX1, SX2
;; 2. Individual units for Neon and FP operations as in cortex-a15-neon.md
;; 3. One pipeline for branch operations: BX
;; 4. One pipeline for integer multiply and divide operations: MX
;; 5. Two pipelines for load and store operations: LS1, LS2
;;
;; We can issue into three pipelines per-cycle.
;;
;; We assume that where we have unit pairs xx1 is always filled before xx2.

;; There are 3 pipelines in the VFP11 unit.
;;
;; - A 8-stage FMAC pipeline (7 execute + writeback) with forward from
;;   fourth stage for simple operations.
;;
;; - A 5-stage DS pipeline (4 execute + writeback) for divide/sqrt insns.
;;   These insns also uses first execute stage of FMAC pipeline.
;;
;; - A 4-stage LS pipeline (execute + 2 memory + writeback) with forward from
;;   second memory stage for loads.

;; We do not model Write-After-Read hazards.
;; We do not do write scheduling with the arm core, so it is only necessary
;; to model the first stage of each pipeline
;; ??? Need to model LS pipeline properly for load/store multiple?
;; We do not model fmstat properly.  This could be done by modeling pipelines
;; properly and defining an absence set between a dummy fmstat unit and all
;; other vfp units.

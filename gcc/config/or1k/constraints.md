; We use:
;  c - sibcall registers
;  d - double pair base registers (excludes r0, r30 and r31 which overflow)
;  t - got address registers (excludes LR (r9) which is clobbered by set_got)
;  I - constant signed 16-bit
;  K - constant unsigned 16-bit
;  M - constant signed 16-bit shifted left 16-bits (l.movhi)
;  O - constant zero

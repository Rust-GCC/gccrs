;; Thigs to improve:
;;
;; - Store instructions are implemented by micro-ops, one of which
;;   generates the store address and is executed in the store address
;;   generation unit in the slot0.  We need to model that.
;;
;; - There are two V3 pipes connected to different slots.  The current
;;   implementation assumes that all the instructions executing in a
;;   V3 pipe are issued to the unit in slot3.
;;
;; - Single-issue ALU operations incur an additional cycle of latency to
;;   slot 0 and slot 1 instructions.  This is not currently reflected
;;   in the DFA.

;; The S5 core has two dual-issue queues, PQLS and PQEX.  Each queue
;; is divided into two slots: PQLS corresponds to slots 0 and 1, and
;; PQEX corresponds to slots 2 and 3.  The core can issue 4
;; instructions per-cycle, and up to 4 instructions are committed each
;; cycle.

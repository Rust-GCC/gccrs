/* Add any extra modes needed to represent the condition code.

   We have a CCNZ mode which is used for implicit comparisons with zero when
   arithmetic instructions set the condition code.  Only the N and Z flags
   are valid in this mode, which means that only the =,!= and <,>= operators
   can be used in conjunction with it.

   We also have a CCCmode which is used by the arithmetic instructions when
   they explicitly set the C flag (unsigned overflow).  Only the unsigned
   <,>= operators can be used in conjunction with it.

   We also have a CCVmode which is used by the arithmetic instructions when
   they explicitly set the V flag (signed overflow).  Only the =,!= operators
   can be used in conjunction with it.

   We also have two modes to indicate that the relevant condition code is
   in the floating-point condition code register.  One for comparisons which
   will generate an exception if the result is unordered (CCFPEmode) and
   one for comparisons which will never trap (CCFPmode).

   CC modes are used for the 32-bit ICC, CCX modes for the 64-bit XCC.  */

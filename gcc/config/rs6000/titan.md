;; We model the divider for the worst-case (i.e. a full 32-bit

;; define_bypass with a guard-function could be used... however, this
;; would be an optimization of doubtful value, as a large number of
;; divides will operate on 32-bit variables.

;; To avoid an unmanagably large automata (generating the automata
;; would require well over 2GB in memory), we don't model the shared
;; result bus on this one. The divider-pipeline is thus modeled
;; through its latency and initial disptach bottlenecks (i.e. issue
;; slots and fxu scheduler availability)

;; === FPU scheduling ===

;; In order to keep the automaton for the Titan FPU efficient and
;; maintainable, we've kept in as concise as possible and created a
;; mapping for the main "choke points" only instead of modelling the
;; overall flow of instructions through the FP-pipeline(s).

;; The key elements modelled are:
;;  * each FP-instruction takes up one of the two issue slots 
;;  * the FPU runs at half the core frequency
;;  * divides are not pipelined (but execute in a separate unit)
;;  * the FPU has a shared result bus for all its units

;; Please note, that the non-pipelined FP-instructions "mcrfs",
;; "mtfsb0[.]", "mtfsb1[.]", "mtfsf[.]", "mtfsfi[.]" are not
;; accessible from regular language constructs (i.e. they are not used
;; by the code generator, except for special purpose sequences defined
;; in rs6000.md), no special provisions are made for these.

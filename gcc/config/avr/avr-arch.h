AVR_ISA_RMW
  Only few avr devices have Read-Modify-Write (RMW) instructions
  (XCH, LAC, LAS and LAT)

AVR_SHORT_SP
  Stack Pointer has only 8 bit width.
  The device / multilib has an 8-bit stack pointer (no SPH).

AVR_ERRATA_SKIP
  Some AVR devices have a core erratum when skipping a 2-word instruction.
  Skip instructions are:  SBRC, SBRS, SBIC, SBIS, CPSE.
  Problems will occur with return address is IRQ executes during the
  skip sequence.

  A support ticket from Atmel returned the following information:

     Subject: (ATTicket:644469) On AVR skip-bug core Erratum
     From: avr@atmel.com                    Date: 2011-07-27
     (Please keep the subject when replying to this mail)

     This errata exists only in AT90S8515 and ATmega103 devices.

     For information please refer the following respective errata links
       http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2494.pdf
       http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc1436.pdf

AVR_ISA_RCALL
  Always use RJMP / RCALL and assume JMP / CALL are not available.
  This affects multilib selection via specs generation and -mshort-calls.
  Even if a device like ATtiny417 from avrxmega3 supports JMP / CALL, we
  assume these instructions are not available and we set the built-in
  macro __AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL__ accordingly.  This macro is used to
  determine a rough estimate of flash size in libgcc, and AVR-LibC uses
  this macro to determine vector sizes.  */

/* Define ISAs for the -march option, used both in m68k.cc and to
   generate m68k-tables.opt.  Before including this file, define a
   macro:

   M68K_ISA (NAME, DEVICE, MICROARCH, ISA, FLAGS)

   where NAME is the name for use with -march=, DEVICE is the value in
   the target_device enumeration of a representative device, FLAGS is
   the set of FL_* flags that apply to this ISA and the other
   arguments are as for M68K_DEVICE in m68k-devices.def.  */

# This script takes the following arguments:
#
#    - the target sysroot
#    - the value of $(MULTILIB_MATCHES)
#    - the value of $(MULTILIB_OPTIONS)
#
# It uses these arguments to construct a definition of SYSROOT_SUFFIX_SPEC,
# which it prints to the standard output.  For each multilib directory FOO,
# the script checks whether $sysroot has a subdirectory FOO, and if so will
# use /FOO for all compatible command-line options.  It will not add a
# suffix for /FOO's options otherwise.  These suffixes are concatenated,
# with one subspec for each space-separated entry in $(MULTILIB_OPTIONS).

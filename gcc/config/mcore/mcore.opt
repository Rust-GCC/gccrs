m210
Target RejectNegative InverseMask(M340)
Generate code for the M*Core M210.

m340
Target RejectNegative Mask(M340)
Generate code for the M*Core M340.

m4byte-functions
Target Mask(OVERALIGN_FUNC)
Force functions to be aligned to a 4 byte boundary.

mbig-endian
Target RejectNegative InverseMask(LITTLE_END)
Generate big-endian code.

mcallgraph-data
Target Mask(CG_DATA)
Emit call graph information.

mdiv
Target Mask(DIV)
Use the divide instruction.

mhardlit
Target Mask(HARDLIT)
Inline constants if it can be done in 2 insns or less.

mlittle-endian
Target RejectNegative Mask(LITTLE_END)
Generate little-endian code.

; Not used by the compiler proper.
mno-lsim
Target RejectNegative
Assume that run-time support has been provided, so omit -lsim from the linker command line.

mrelax-immediates
Target Mask(RELAX_IMM)
Use arbitrary sized immediates in bit operations.

mslow-bytes
Target Mask(SLOW_BYTES)
Prefer word accesses over byte accesses.

; Maximum size we are allowed to grow the stack in a single operation.
; If we want more, we must do it in increments of at most this size.
; If this value is 0, we don't check at all.
mstack-increment=
Target RejectNegative Joined UInteger Var(mcore_stack_increment) Init(STACK_UNITS_MAXSTEP)
Set the maximum amount for a single stack increment operation.

mwide-bitfields
Target Mask(W_FIELD)
Always treat bitfields as int-sized.

# Multilibs for VxWorks.  We want these 8 architecture combinations:
#
#    {-mips2,-mips3} x {-EB,-EL} x {-mhard-float,-msoft-float}
#
# where the first option in each group is the default.  The -mips2
# multilibs use o32 and the -mips3 multilibs use o64.
#
# We want three multilibs for each architecture combination:
# default (kernel mode), -mrtp and -mrtp/-fPIC.

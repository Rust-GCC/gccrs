;; BPF CO-RE immediate constraints.
;; This constraints are used to match with the immediate operand that is
;; represented with an UNSPEC_CORE_RELOC. This unspec is the result of using the
;; BPF CO-RE infrastructure.
;; It differentiates from a normal immediate constraints, as the instruction
;; will also emit a BTF based specific relocation, i.e. a CO-RE relocation.

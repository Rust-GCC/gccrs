# Because the pdp11 POINTER_SIZE is only 16, in dwarf2out.cc,
# DWARF_ARANGES_PAD_SIZE is 0, thus a loop in output_aranges that checks
# (i < (unsigned) DWARF_ARANGES_PAD_SIZE) elicits a warning that the
# comparison is always false.
# We could say "-Werror -Wno-error=type-limits", alas, not all supported
# gcc bootstrap compilers support the latter option.

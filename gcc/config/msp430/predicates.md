;   "If the number of references to the variable in the source code matches
;    the number of references to the variable in the assembly template, we can
;    safely allow a volatile memory reference".
;      - paraphrasing DJ Delorie here:
;	 https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2014-05/msg00870.html
; When applied to instruction patterns, this means that we can only allow
; volatile memory when the output assembler template contains only one
; instruction which references that volatile address.

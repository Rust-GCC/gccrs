;; GR5 is a single-issue processor.

;; CPU execution units:
;;
;; issue                  Only one instruction can be issued on a given cycle.
;;                        There is no need to model the CPU pipeline in any
;;                        more detail than this.
;;
;; mem                    Memory Unit: all accesses to memory.
;;
;; eam                    Extended Arithmetic Module: multiply, divide and
;;                        64-bit shifts.
;;
;; fp_slot[0|1|2|3]       The 4 FIFO slots of the floating-point unit.  Only
;;                        the instruction at slot 0 can execute, but an FP
;;                        instruction can issue if any of the slots is free.

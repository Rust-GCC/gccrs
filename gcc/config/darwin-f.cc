/* Provide stubs for the hooks defined by darwin.h
     TARGET_EXTRA_PRE_INCLUDES, TARGET_EXTRA_INCLUDES

   As both, gcc and gfortran link in incpath.o, we cannot
   conditionally undefine said hooks if fortran is build.
   However, we can define do-nothing stubs of said hooks as
   we are not interested in objc include files in Fortran.

   The hooks original purpose (see also darwin-c.cc):
    * darwin_register_objc_includes
      Register the GNU objective-C runtime include path if STDINC.

    * darwin_register_frameworks
      Register all the system framework paths if STDINC is true and setup
      the missing_header callback for subframework searching if any
      frameworks had been registered.  */

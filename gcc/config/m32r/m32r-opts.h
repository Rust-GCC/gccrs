/* Code Models

   Code models are used to select between two choices of two separate
   possibilities (address space size, call insn to use):

   small: addresses use 24 bits, use bl to make calls
   medium: addresses use 32 bits, use bl to make calls (*1)
   large: addresses use 32 bits, use seth/add3/jl to make calls (*2)

   The fourth is "addresses use 24 bits, use seth/add3/jl to make calls" but
   using this one doesn't make much sense.

   (*1) The linker may eventually be able to relax seth/add3 -> ld24.
   (*2) The linker may eventually be able to relax seth/add3/jl -> bl.

   Internally these are recorded as TARGET_ADDR{24,32} and
   TARGET_CALL{26,32}.

   The __model__ attribute can be used to select the code model to use when
   accessing particular objects.  */

/* Small Data Area

   The SDA consists of sections .sdata, .sbss, and .scommon.
   .scommon isn't a real section, symbols in it have their section index
   set to SHN_M32R_SCOMMON, though support for it exists in the linker script.

   Two switches control the SDA:

   -G NNN        - specifies the maximum size of variable to go in the SDA

   -msdata=foo   - specifies how such variables are handled

        -msdata=none  - small data area is disabled

        -msdata=sdata - small data goes in the SDA, special code isn't
                        generated to use it, and special relocs aren't
                        generated

        -msdata=use   - small data goes in the SDA, special code is generated
                        to use the SDA and special relocs are generated

   The SDA is not multilib'd, it isn't necessary.
   MULTILIB_EXTRA_OPTS is set in tmake_file to -msdata=sdata so multilib'd
   libraries have small data in .sdata/SHN_M32R_SCOMMON so programs that use
   -msdata=use will successfully link with them (references in header files
   will cause the compiler to emit code that refers to library objects in
   .data).  ??? There can be a problem if the user passes a -G value greater
   than the default and a library object in a header file is that size.
   The default is 8 so this should be rare - if it occurs the user
   is required to rebuild the libraries or use a smaller value for -G.  */

   The -msdata=foo switch also controls how small variables are handled.  */

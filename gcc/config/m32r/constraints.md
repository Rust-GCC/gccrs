;; The letters I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P in a register constraint string
;; can be used to stand for particular ranges of immediate operands.
;; The letters Q, R, S, T, U are used to segregate specific types of
;; operands, usually memory references, for the target machine.
;;
;; I is used for 8-bit signed immediates.
;; J is used for 16-bit signed immediates.
;; K is used for 16-bit unsigned immediates.
;; L is used for 16-bit immediates left shifted by 16 (sign ???).
;; M is used for 24-bit unsigned immediates.
;; N is used for 8-bit signed immediates for compares
;;   (values in the range -127 to +128).
;; O is used for 5-bit unsigned immediates (shift count).
;; P is used for 16-bit signed immediates for compares
;;     (values in the range -32767 to +32768).
;;
;; Q is for symbolic addresses loadable with ld24.
;; R is for symbolic addresses when ld24 can't be used.
;; S is for stores with pre {inc,dec}rement
;; T is for indirect of a pointer.
;; U is for loads with post increment.
;; W is used for an immediate value of 0.

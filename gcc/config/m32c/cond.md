; conditionals - cmp, jcc, setcc, etc.

; Special note about conditional instructions: GCC always emits the
; compare right before the insn, which is good, because m32c's mov
; insns modify the flags.  However, this means that any conditional
; insn that may require reloading must be kept with its compare until
; after reload finishes, else the reload insns might clobber the
; flags.  Thus, these rules:
;
; * the cmp* expanders just save the operands in compare_op0 and
;   compare_op1 via m32c_pend_compare.
; * conditional insns that won't need reload can call
;   m32c_unpend_compare before their expansion.
; * other insns must expand to include the compare operands within,
;   then split after reload to a separate compare and conditional.

; Until support for relaxing is supported in gas, we must assume that
; short labels won't reach, so we must use long labels.
; Unfortunately, there aren't any conditional jumps with long labels,
; so instead we invert the conditional and jump around a regular jump.

; Note that we can, at some point in the future, add code to omit the
; "cmp" portion of the insn if the preceding insn happened to set the
; right flags already.  For example, a mov followed by a "cmp *,0" is
; redundant; the move already set the Z flag.

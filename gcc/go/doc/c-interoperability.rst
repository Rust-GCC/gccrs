C Interoperability
------------------

When using :command:`gccgo` there is limited interoperability with C,
or with C++ code compiled using ``extern "C"``.

This information is provided largely for documentation purposes.  For
ordinary use it is best to build programs with the go tool and then
use ``import "C"``, as described at
https://golang.org/cmd/cgo.

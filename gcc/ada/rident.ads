--  This package defines the set of restriction identifiers for use by the
--  compiler and binder. It is in a separate package from Restrict so that
--  it can be used by the binder without dragging in unneeded compiler
--  packages.

--  Note: the actual definitions of the types are in package System.Rident,
--  and this package is merely an instantiation of that package. The point
--  of this level of generic indirection is to allow the compile time use
--  to have the image tables available (this package is not compiled with
--  Discard_Names), while at run-time we do not want those image tables.

--  Rather than have clients instantiate System.Rident directly, we have the
--  single instantiation here at the library level, which means that we only
--  have one copy of the image tables.

package Rident is new System.Rident;

--  This package contains data and functions used to determine if a given unit

--  should not be directly WITH'ed by user code. It also checks for Ada 2005
--  units that should only be WITH'ed in Ada 2005 mode, and Ada 2012 units
--  that should only be WITH'ed in Ada 2012 mode.

      --  generated code, or from the implementation of the run time. Use of
      --  such a unit generates a warning unless the client is compiled with
      --  the -gnatg switch. If we are being super strict, this should be an
      --  error for the case of Ada units, but that seems over strenuous.

      --  give a warning when withing a unit from a wrong mode (e.g. withing an
      --  Ada_2012_Unit when compiling with -gnat95). Note that in Ada 83 mode,
      --  no child units are allowed, so you can't even name such a unit.

   function Get_Kind_Of_Unit (U : Unit_Number_Type) return Kind_Of_Unit;
   --  Given the unit number of a unit, this function determines the type
   --  of the unit, as defined above. If the result is Implementation_Unit,
   --  then the name of a possible alternative equivalent unit is placed in
   --  Error_Msg_String/Slen on return. If there is no alternative name, or if
   --  the result is not Implementation_Unit, then Error_Msg_Slen is zero on
   --  return, indicating that no alternative name was found.

   function Is_Known_Unit (Nam : Node_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Nam is the possible name of a child unit, represented as a selected
   --  component node. This function determines whether the name matches one of
   --  the known library units, and if so, returns True. If the name does not
   --  match any known library unit, False is returned.

   function Not_Impl_Defined_Unit (U : Unit_Number_Type) return Boolean;
   --  This function returns True if U represents a unit that is permitted by
   --  the restriction No_Implementation_Units (i.e. a unit in the Ada, System,
   --  and Interfaces hierarchies that is defined in the RM, or a user defined
   --  unit. It returns False if U represents a unit that is not permitted by
   --  this restriction, which includes units in these three hierarchies that
   --  are GNAT implementation defined. It also returns False for any units in
   --  the GNAT hierarchy, which is not strictly conforming, but so obviously
   --  useful that it is a reasonable deviation from the standard.

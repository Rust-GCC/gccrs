package Bcheck is

--  This package contains the routines to perform binder consistency checks

   procedure Check_Duplicated_Subunits;
   --  Check that no subunit names duplicate names of other packages in
   --  the partition (check required by RM 10.2(19)).

   procedure Check_Versions;
   --  Check correct library and standard versions used

   procedure Check_Consistency;
   --  This procedure performs checks that the ALI files are consistent
   --  with the corresponding source files and with one another. At the
   --  time this is called, the Source table has been completely built and
   --  contains either the time stamp from the actual source file if the
   --  Check_Source_Files mode is set, or the latest stamp found in any of
   --  the ALI files in the program.

   procedure Check_Configuration_Consistency;
   --  This procedure performs a similar check that configuration pragma
   --  set items that are required to be consistent are in fact consistent

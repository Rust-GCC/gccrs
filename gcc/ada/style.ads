   --  pointing to a NOT token. Used to check proper layout of NOT IN.

   procedure Check_Pragma_Name

   --  set, forbidding the explicit use of mode IN.

   procedure No_End_Name (Name : Node_Id)
     renames Style_Inst.No_End_Name;
   --  Called if an END is encountered where a name is allowed but not present.
   --  The parameter is the node whose name is the name that is permitted in
   --  the END line, and the scan pointer is positioned so that if an error
   --  message is to be generated in this situation, it should be generated
   --  using Error_Msg_SP.

     renames Style_Inst.No_Exit_Name;
   --  Called when exiting a named loop, but a name is not present on the EXIT.
   --  The parameter is the node whose name should have followed EXIT, and the
   --  scan pointer is positioned so that if an error message is to be
   --  generated, it should be generated using Error_Msg_SP.

   procedure Non_Lower_Case_Keyword
     renames Style_Inst.Non_Lower_Case_Keyword;
   --  Called if a reserved keyword is scanned which is not spelled in all
   --  lower case letters. On entry Token_Ptr points to the keyword token.

--  This child package contains the routines to translate a unit name to
--  a file name taking into account Source_File_Name pragmas. It also
--  contains the auxiliary routines used to record data from the pragmas.

--  Note: the reason we split this into a child unit is that the routines
--  for unit name translation have a significant number of additional
--  dependencies, including osint, and hence sdefault. There are a number
--  of tools that use utility subprograms in the Fname parent, but do not
--  need the functionality in this child package (and certainly do not want
--  to deal with the extra dependencies).

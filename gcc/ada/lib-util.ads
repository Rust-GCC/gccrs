   --  This package implements a buffered write of library information

   procedure Write_Info_Char (C : Character);
   pragma Inline (Write_Info_Char);
   --  Adds one character to the info

   procedure Write_Info_Char_Code (Code : Char_Code);
   --  Write a single character code. Upper half values in the range
   --  16#80..16#FF are written as Uhh (hh = 2 hex digits), and values
   --  greater than 16#FF are written as Whhhh (hhhh = 4 hex digits).

   function Write_Info_Col return Positive;
   --  Returns the column in which the next character will be written

   procedure Write_Info_EOL;
   --  Terminate current info line. This only flushes the buffer
   --  if there is not enough room for another complete line or
   --  if the host system needs a write for each line.

   procedure Write_Info_Initiate (Key : Character);
   --  Initiates write of new line to info file, the parameter is the keyword
   --  character for the line. The caller is responsible for writing the
   --  required blank after the key character if needed.

   procedure Write_Info_Nat (N : Nat);
   --  Adds image of N to Info_Buffer with no leading or trailing blanks

   procedure Write_Info_Int (N : Int);
   --  Adds image of N to Info_Buffer with no leading or trailing blanks. A
   --  minus sign is prepended for negative values.

   procedure Write_Info_Name (Name : Unit_Name_Type);
   --  Adds characters of Name to Info_Buffer. Note that in all cases, the
   --  name is written literally from the names table entry without modifying
   --  the case, using simply Get_Name_String.

   procedure Write_Info_Name_May_Be_Quoted (Name : File_Name_Type);
   --  Similar to Write_Info_Name, but if Name includes spaces, then it is
   --  quoted and the '"' are doubled.

   procedure Write_Info_Slit (S : String_Id);
   --  Write string literal value in format required for L/N lines in ali file

   procedure Write_Info_Str (Val : String);
   --  Adds characters of Val to Info_Buffer surrounded by quotes

   procedure Write_Info_Tab (Col : Positive);
   --  Tab out with blanks and HT's to column Col. If already at or past
   --  Col, writes a single blank, so that we do get a required field
   --  separation.

   procedure Write_Info_Terminate;
   --  Terminate current info line and output lines built in Info_Buffer

   procedure Write_Info_Uint (N : Uint);
   --  Adds decimal image of N to Info_Buffer with no leading or trailing
   --  blanks. A minus sign is prepended for negative values.

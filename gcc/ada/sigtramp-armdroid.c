/* ----------------------
   -- General comments --
   ----------------------

   Stubs are generated from toplevel asms,
   The general idea is to establish CFA as the sigcontext
   and state where to find the registers as offsets from there.

   We support stubs for VxWorks and Android, providing unwind info for
   common registers. We might need variants with support for floating
   point or altivec registers as well at some point.

   For Android it would be simpler to write this in Asm since there's only
   one variant, but to keep it looking like the VxWorks stubs,
   C is the choice for our toplevel interface.

   Note that the registers we "restore" here are those to which we have
   direct access through the system sigcontext structure, which includes
   only a partial set of the non-volatiles ABI-wise.  */

/* -----------------------------------------
   -- Protypes for our internal asm stubs --
   -----------------------------------------

   The registers are expected to be at SIGCONTEXT + 12 (reference the
   sicontext structure in asm/sigcontext.h which describes the first
   3 * 4byte fields.)  Even though our symbols will remain local, the
   prototype claims "extern" and not "static" to prevent compiler complaints
   about a symbol used but never defined.  */

--  This package contains the function used to read SCO information from an ALI
--  file and populate the tables defined in package SCOs with the result.

generic
   --  These subprograms provide access to the ALI file. Locating, opening and
   --  providing access to the ALI file is the callers' responsibility.

   with function Getc return Character is <>;
   --  Get next character, positioning the ALI file ready to read the following
   --  character (equivalent to calling Nextc, then Skipc). If the end of file
   --  is encountered, the value Types.EOF is returned.

   with function Nextc return Character is <>;
   --  Look at the next character, and return it, leaving the position of the
   --  file unchanged, so that a subsequent call to Getc or Nextc will return
   --  this same character. If the file is positioned at the end of file, then
   --  Types.EOF is returned.

   with procedure Skipc is <>;
   --  Skip past the current character (which typically was read with Nextc),
   --  and position to the next character, which will be returned by the next
   --  call to Getc or Nextc.

procedure Get_SCOs;
--  Load SCO information from ALI file text format into internal SCO tables
--  (SCOs.SCO_Table and SCOs.SCO_Unit_Table). On entry the input file is
--  positioned to the initial 'C' of the first SCO line in the ALI file.
--  On return, the file is positioned either to the end of file, or to the
--  first character of the line following the SCO information (which will
--  never start with a 'C').
--
--  If a format error is detected in the input, then an exception is raised
--  (Ada.IO_Exceptions.Data_Error), with the file positioned to the error.

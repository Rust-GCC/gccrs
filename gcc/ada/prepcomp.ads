   --  preprocessing if there are some: all files are preprocessed with these
   --  symbols. This procedure should not be called if there is a preprocessing
   --  data file specified on the command line. Instead a call should be made
   --  to Parse_Preprocessing_Data_File.

   --  Check symbol definitions that have been added by calls to procedure
   --  Add_Symbol_Definition and stored as pointers to string, and put them in
   --  a table. The reason the definitions were stored as pointer to strings is
   --  that the name table is not yest initialized when we process the command
   --  line switches. These symbol definitions will be later used in
   --  the call to Prepare_To_Preprocess.

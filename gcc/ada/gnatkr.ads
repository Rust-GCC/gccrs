--  This is a small utility program that incorporates the file krunching
--  algorithm used by the GNAT compiler (when the -gnatk switch is used)

--     gnatkr  filename  length

--  where length is a decimal value, outputs to standard output the krunched
--  name, followed by the original input file name. The file name has an
--  optional extension, which, if present, is copied unchanged to the output.
--  The length argument is optional and defaults to the system default if
--  there is one, otherwise to 8.

procedure Gnatkr;
--  Execute above described command. This is an Ada main program which
--  sets an exit status (set to Success or Failure as appropriate)

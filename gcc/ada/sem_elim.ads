   --  Process eliminate pragma (given by Pragma_Node). The number of
   --  arguments has been checked, as well as possible optional identifiers,
   --  but no other checks have been made. This subprogram completes the
   --  checking, and then if the pragma is well formed, makes appropriate
   --  entries in the internal tables used to keep track of Eliminate pragmas.
   --  The other five arguments are expressions (rather than pragma argument
   --  associations) for the possible pragma arguments. A parameter that
   --  is not present is set to Empty.

   procedure Check_Eliminated (E : Entity_Id);
   --  Checks if entity E is eliminated, and if so sets the Is_Eliminated
   --  flag on the given entity.

   procedure Check_For_Eliminated_Subprogram (N : Node_Id; S : Entity_Id);
   --  Check that the subprogram S (or its ultimate parent in the case of a
   --  derived subprogram or renaming) has not been eliminated. An error will
   --  be flagged if the subprogram has been eliminated, unless the node N
   --  occurs within an eliminated subprogram or within a generic unit. The
   --  error will be posted on N.

   procedure Eliminate_Error_Msg (N : Node_Id; E : Entity_Id);
   --  Called by the front-end on encountering a reference to an eliminated
   --  subprogram. N is the node for the reference (such as occurs in a call,
   --  a protected call or an  attribute), and E is the entity of the
   --  subprogram that has been eliminated.

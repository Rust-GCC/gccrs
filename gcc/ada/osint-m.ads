--  This package contains the low level, operating system routines used only
--  in gnatmake for command line processing and file input output.

package Osint.M is

   function More_Source_Files return Boolean;
   --  Indicates whether more source file remain to be processed. Returns
   --  False right away if no source files, or if all source files have
   --  been processed.

   function Next_Main_Source return File_Name_Type;
   --  This function returns the name of the next main source file specified
   --  on the command line. It is an error to call Next_Main_Source if no more
   --  source files exist (i.e. Next_Main_Source may be called only if a
   --  previous call to More_Source_Files returned True). This name is the
   --  simple file name (without any directory information).

   function Object_File_Name (N : File_Name_Type) return File_Name_Type;
   --  Constructs the name of the object file corresponding to library
   --  file N. If N is a full file name than the returned file name will
   --  also be a full file name. Note that no lookup in the library file
   --  directories is done for this file. This routine merely constructs
   --  the name.

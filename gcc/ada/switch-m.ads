   --  Scan a gnatmake switch and act accordingly. For switches that are
   --  recognized, Success is set to True. A switch that is not recognized and
   --  consists of one small letter causes a fatal error exit and control does
   --  not return. For all other not recognized switches, Success is set to
   --  False, so that the switch may be passed to the compiler.

   --  of the last simple switch. Last is equal to zero, if it has been
   --  determined that Switch_Chars is ill-formed or does not contain any
   --  switch that should be stored in an ALI file. Otherwise, the list of
   --  simple switches is Switches (Switches'First .. Last).
   --
   --    Example: if Switch_Chars is equal to "-gnatAwue", then the list of
   --    simple switches will have 3 components: -gnatA, -gnatwu, -gnatwe.

   --  they are shallow copies of components in a table in the body.

   --  that Switch_Chars is ill-formed or does not contain any switch that
   --  should be stored in an ALI file. The String_Access components of the
   --  returned value should not be deallocated.

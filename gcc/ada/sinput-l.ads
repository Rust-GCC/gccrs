   --  in the source file table. If the file is not currently loaded, then
   --  this is the call that causes the source file to be read and an entry
   --  made in the table. A new entry in the table has the file name and time
   --  stamp entries set and the Casing entries set to Unknown. Version is set
   --  to all blanks, and the lines table is initialized but only the first
   --  entry is set (and Last_Line is set to 1). If the given source file
   --  cannot be opened, then the value returned is No_Source_File.

   function Load_Config_File (N : File_Name_Type) return Source_File_Index;
   --  Similar to Load_Source_File, except that the file name is always
   --  interpreted in the context of the current working directory.
   --  The file is never preprocessed.

     (N : File_Name_Type) return Source_File_Index;
   --  Loads preprocessing data file. Similar to Load_Source_File except
   --  that this file is not itself preprocessed.

   procedure Complete_Source_File_Entry;
   --  Called on completing the parsing of a source file. This call completes
   --  the source file table entry for the current source file.

   function Source_File_Is_Body (X : Source_File_Index) return Boolean;
   --  Returns true if the designated source file contains a subprogram body
   --  or a package body. This is a limited scan just to determine the answer
   --  to this question.

   function Source_File_Is_No_Body (X : Source_File_Index) return Boolean;
   --  Returns true if the designated source file contains pragma No_Body;
   --  and no other tokens. If the source file contains anything other than
   --  this sequence of three tokens, then False is returned.

   --  Adjust_Instantiation_Sloc. Template_Id can also be a subunit body that
   --  replaces a stub in a generic unit.

   --  cases. This is used for generating error messages that distinguish these
   --  two cases, otherwise the two cases are handled identically. Similarly,
   --  the instantiation mechanism is also used for inherited class-wide pre-

About This Guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. only:: PRO

   For ease of exposition, 'GNAT Pro' will be referred to simply as
   'GNAT' in the remainder of this document.

This guide describes the use of GNAT,
a compiler and software development
toolset for the full Ada programming language.
It documents the features of the compiler and tools, and explains
how to use them to build Ada applications.

GNAT implements Ada 95, Ada 2005, Ada 2012, and Ada 2022.  You may
also invoke it in Ada 83 compatibility mode.  By default, GNAT assumes
Ada 2012, but you can use a compiler switch
(:ref:`Compiling_Different_Versions_of_Ada`) to explicitly specify the
language version.  Throughout this manual, references to 'Ada' without
a year suffix apply to all versions of the Ada language starting with
Ada 95.

GNAT supports both the GCC and LLVM back end compilation families.
Most GNAT versions use the GCC back end, but some are now available using
the LLVM back end. In some places in this manual, we distinguish between
the two back ends, but in most cases, everything in this manual applies
to both back ends. We refer to GNAT with the LLVM back end as 'GNAT LLVM'.
See :ref:`GNATLLVM` for limitations of GNAT LLVM.

What This Guide Contains
========================

This guide contains the following chapters:

* :ref:`Getting_Started_with_GNAT` describes how to get started compiling
  and running Ada programs with the GNAT Ada programming environment.

* :ref:`The_GNAT_Compilation_Model` describes the compilation model used
  by GNAT.

* :ref:`Building_Executable_Programs_With_GNAT` describes how to use the
  main GNAT tools to build executable programs, and it also gives examples of
  using the GNU make utility with GNAT.

* :ref:`GNAT_Utility_Programs` explains the various utility programs that
  are included in the GNAT environment.

* :ref:`GNAT_and_Program_Execution` covers a number of topics related to
  running, debugging, and tuning the performance of programs developed
  with GNAT.

Appendices cover several additional topics:

* :ref:`Platform_Specific_Information` describes the different run-time
  library implementations and also presents information on how to use
  GNAT on several specific platforms.

* :ref:`Example_of_Binder_Output_File` shows the source code for the binder
  output file for a sample program.

* :ref:`Elaboration_Order_Handling_in_GNAT` describes how GNAT helps
  you deal with elaboration order issues.

* :ref:`Inline_Assembler` shows how to use the inline assembly facility
  in an Ada program.



What You Should Know before Reading This Guide
==============================================

.. index:: Ada 95 Language Reference Manual

.. index:: Ada 2005 Language Reference Manual

This guide assumes a basic familiarity with the Ada 95 language, as
described in the International Standard ANSI/ISO/IEC-8652:1995, January
1995.
Reference manuals for Ada 95, Ada 2005, and Ada 2012 are included in
the GNAT documentation package.

  If you are using GNAT on a Windows platform, please note that
  you should use the '\\' character instead.

--  This package contains the function used to read SCO information from the
--  internal tables defined in package SCOs, and output text information for
--  the ALI file. The interface allows control over the destination of the
--  output, so that this routine can also be used for debugging purposes.

generic
   --  The following procedures are used to output text information. The
   --  destination of the text information is thus under control of the
   --  particular instantiation. In particular, this procedure is used to
   --  write output to the ALI file, and also for debugging output.

   with procedure Write_Info_Char (C : Character) is <>;
   --  Outputs one character

   with procedure Write_Info_Initiate (Key : Character) is <>;
   --  Initiates write of new line to output file, the parameter is the
   --  keyword character for the line.

   with procedure Write_Info_Name (Nam : Name_Id) is <>;
   --  Outputs one name

   with procedure Write_Info_Nat (N : Nat) is <>;
   --  Writes image of N to output file with no leading or trailing blanks

   with procedure Write_Info_Terminate is <>;
   --  Terminate current info line and output lines built in Info_Buffer

procedure Put_SCOs;
--  Read information from SCOs.SCO_Table and SCOs.SCO_Unit_Table and output
--  corresponding information in ALI format using the Write_Info procedures.

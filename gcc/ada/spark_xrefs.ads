   Name_Of_Heap_Variable : constant String := "__HEAP";
   --  Name of special variable used in effects to denote reads and writes
   --  through explicit dereference.

   Heap : Entity_Id := Empty;
   --  A special entity which denotes the heap object; it should be considered
   --  constant, but needs to be variable, because it can only be initialized
   --  after the node tables are created. Also, it is only created if there is
   --  an actual need for it, and remains Empty otherwise.

   -- Subprograms for Writing Debug Source Files --
   ------------------------------------------------

   procedure Create_Debug_Source
     (Source : Source_File_Index;
      Loc    : out Source_Ptr);
   --  Given a source file, creates a new source file table entry to be used
   --  for the debug source file output (Debug_Generated_Code switch set).
   --  Loc is set to the initial Sloc value for the first line. This call
   --  also creates the debug source output file (using Create_Debug_File).

   procedure Write_Debug_Line (Str : String; Loc : in out Source_Ptr);
   --  This procedure is called to write a line to the debug source file
   --  previously created by Create_Debug_Source using Write_Debug_Info.
   --  Str is the source line to be written to the file (it does not include
   --  an end of line character). On entry Loc is the Sloc value previously
   --  returned by Create_Debug_Source or Write_Debug_Line, and on exit,
   --  Sloc is updated to point to the start of the next line to be written,
   --  taking into account the length of the terminator that was written by
   --  Write_Debug_Info.

   procedure Close_Debug_Source;
   --  This procedure completes the source table entry for the debug file
   --  previously created by Create_Debug_Source, and written using the
   --  Write_Debug_Line procedure. It then calls Close_Debug_File to
   --  complete the writing of the file itself.

   procedure Generate_CG_Output;
   --  Generate in the standard output the information associated with tagged
   --  types declaration and dispatching calls

   procedure Initialize;
   --  Called at the start of compilation to initialize the table that stores
   --  the tree nodes used by Generate_Output. This table is required because
   --  the format of the output requires fully qualified names (and hence the
   --  output must be generated after the source program has been compiled).

   procedure Register_CG_Node (N : Node_Id);
   --  Register a dispatching call node or the defining entity of a tagged
   --  type declaration

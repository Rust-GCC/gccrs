--  Sort utility (Using Heapsort Algorithm)

--  This package provides a heapsort routine that works with access to
--  subprogram parameters, so that it can be used with different types with
--  shared sorting code.

--  This heapsort algorithm uses approximately N*log(N) compares in the
--  worst case and is in place with no additional storage required. See
--  the body for exact details of the algorithm used.

--  See also GNAT.Heap_Sort_G which is a generic version that will be faster
--  since the overhead of the indirect calls is avoided, at the expense of
--  generic code duplication and less convenient interface.

--  Note: GNAT.Heap_Sort replaces and obsoletes GNAT.Heap_Sort_A, which is
--  retained in the GNAT library for backwards compatibility.

package GNAT.Heap_Sort is
   pragma Pure;

   --  The data to be sorted is assumed to be indexed by integer values
   --  from 1 to N, where N is the number of items to be sorted.

   type Xchg_Procedure is access procedure (Op1, Op2 : Natural);
   --  A pointer to a procedure that exchanges the two data items whose
   --  index values are Op1 and Op2.

   type Lt_Function is access function (Op1, Op2 : Natural) return Boolean;
   --  A pointer to a function that compares two items and returns True if
   --  the item with index value Op1 is less than the item with Index value
   --  Op2, and False if the Op1 item is greater than the Op2 item. If
   --  the items are equal, then it does not matter if True or False is
   --  returned (but it is slightly more efficient to return False).

   procedure Sort (N : Natural; Xchg : Xchg_Procedure; Lt : Lt_Function);
   --  This procedures sorts items in the range from 1 to N into ascending
   --  order making calls to Lt to do required comparisons, and calls to
   --  Xchg to exchange items. The sort is not stable, that is the order
   --  of equal items in the input data set is not preserved.

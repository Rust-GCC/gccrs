--  This package contains generic subprograms used for converting between
--  sequences of Character and Wide_Character. Wide_Wide_Character values
--  are also handled, but represented using integer range types defined in
--  this package, so that this package can be used from applications that
--  are restricted to Ada 95 compatibility (such as the compiler itself).

--  All the algorithms for encoding and decoding are isolated in this package
--  and in System.WCh_JIS and should not be duplicated elsewhere. The only
--  exception to this is that GNAT.Decode_String and GNAT.Encode_String have
--  their own circuits for UTF-8 conversions, for improved efficiency.

--  This unit may be used directly from an application program by providing
--  an appropriate WITH, and the interface can be expected to remain stable.

   --  C is the first character of a sequence of one or more characters which
   --  represent a wide character sequence. Calling the function In_Char for
   --  additional characters as required, Char_To_Wide_Char returns the
   --  corresponding wide character value. Constraint_Error is raised if the
   --  sequence of characters encountered is not a valid wide character
   --  sequence for the given encoding method.
   --
   --  Note on the use of brackets encoding (WCEM_Brackets). The brackets
   --  encoding method is ambiguous in the context of this function, since
   --  there is no way to tell if ["1234"] is eight unencoded characters or
   --  one encoded character. In the context of Ada sources, any sequence
   --  starting [" must be the start of an encoding (since that sequence is
   --  not valid in Ada source otherwise). The routines in this package use
   --  the same approach. If the input string contains the sequence [" then
   --  this is assumed to be the start of a brackets encoding sequence, and
   --  if it does not match the syntax, an error is raised.

   --  Constraint_Error is raised if the given wide character value is
   --  not a valid value for the given encoding method.
   --
   --  Note on brackets encoding (WCEM_Brackets). For the input routines above,
   --  upper half characters can be represented as ["hh"] but this procedure
   --  will only use brackets encodings for codes higher than 16#FF#, so upper
   --  half characters will be output as single Character values.

--  Run-time non-symbolic traceback support

--  This package provides a method for generating a traceback of the
--  current execution location. The traceback shows the locations of
--  calls in the call chain, up to either the top or a designated
--  number of levels.

--  The traceback information is in the form of absolute code locations.
--  These code locations may be converted to corresponding source locations
--  using the external addr2line utility, or from within GDB.

--  In order to use this facility, in some cases the binder must be invoked
--  with -E switch (store the backtrace with exception occurrence). Please
--  refer to gnatbind documentation for more information.

--  To analyze the code locations later using addr2line or gdb, the necessary
--  units must be compiled with the debugging switch -g in the usual manner.
--  Note that it is not necessary to compile with -g to use Call_Chain. In
--  other words, the following sequence of steps can be used:

--     Compile without -g
--     Run the program, and call Call_Chain
--     Recompile with -g
--     Use addr2line to interpret the absolute call locations (note that
--      addr2line expects addresses in hexadecimal format).

--  This capability is currently supported on the following targets:

--     AiX PowerPC
--     GNU/Linux x86
--     GNU/Linux PowerPC
--     LynxOS x86
--     LynxOS 178 xcoff PowerPC
--     LynxOS 178 elf PowerPC
--     Solaris x86
--     Solaris sparc
--     VxWorks ARM
--     VxWorks7 ARM
--     VxWorks PowerPC
--     VxWorks x86
--     Windows XP

--  Note: see also GNAT.Traceback.Symbolic, a child unit in file g-trasym.ads
--  providing symbolic trace back capability for a subset of the above targets.

--  This package may be used to intercept the interruption of a running
--  program by the operator typing Control-C, without having to use an Ada
--  interrupt handler protected object.

--  This package is currently implemented under Windows and Unix platforms

--  Note concerning Unix systems:

--  The behavior of this package when using tasking depends on the interaction
--  between sigaction() and the thread library.

   type Handler_Type is access procedure;
   --  Any parameterless library level procedure can be used as a handler.
   --  Handler_Type should not propagate exceptions.

   procedure Install_Handler (Handler : Handler_Type);
   --  Set up Handler to be called if the operator hits Ctrl-C, instead of the
   --  standard Control-C handler.

   procedure Uninstall_Handler;
   --  Reinstall the standard Control-C handler.
   --  If Install_Handler has never been called, this procedure has no effect.

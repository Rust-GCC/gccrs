   --  This is set True if we do not need more than 32 bits in the result. If
   --  we need 64-bits, we will only use the meaningful 48 bits of any 64-bit
   --  number generated, since if more than 48 bits are required, we split the
   --  computation into two separate parts, since the algorithm does not behave
   --  above 48 bits.

   --  The way this expression works is that obviously if the size is 31 bits,
   --  it fits in 32 bits. In the 32-bit case, it fits in 32-bit signed if the
   --  range has negative values. It is too conservative in the case that the
   --  programmer has set a size greater than the default, e.g. a size of 33
   --  for an integer type with a range of 1..10, but an over-conservative
   --  result is OK. The important thing is that the value is only True if
   --  we know the result will fit in 32-bits signed. If the value is False
   --  when it could be True, the behavior will be correct, just a bit less
   --  efficient than it could have been in some unusual cases.
   --
   --  One might assume that we could get a more accurate result by testing
   --  the lower and upper bounds of the type Rst against the bounds of 32-bit
   --  Integer. However, there is no easy way to do that. Why? Because in the
   --  relatively rare case where this expression has to be evaluated at run
   --  time rather than compile time (when the bounds are dynamic), we need a
   --  type to use for the computation. But the possible range of upper bound
   --  values for Rst (remembering the possibility of 64-bit modular types) is
   --  from -2**63 to 2**64-1, and no run-time type has a big enough range.

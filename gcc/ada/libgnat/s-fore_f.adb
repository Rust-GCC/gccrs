package body System.Fore_F is

   Maxdigs : constant Natural := Int'Width - 2;
   --  Maximum number of decimal digits that can be represented in an Int.
   --  The "-2" accounts for the sign and one extra digit, since we need the
   --  maximum number of 9's that can be represented, e.g. for the 64-bit case,
   --  Integer_64'Width is 20 since the maximum value is approximately 9.2E+18
   --  and has 19 digits, but the maximum number of 9's that can be represented
   --  in Integer_64 is only 18.

   --  The first prerequisite of the implementation is that the scaled divide
   --  does not overflow, which means that the absolute value of the bounds of
   --  the subtype must be smaller than 10**Maxdigs * 2**(Int'Size - 1).
   --  Otherwise Constraint_Error is raised by the scaled divide operation.

   --  The second prerequisite is that the computation of the operands does not
   --  overflow, which means that, if the small is larger than 1, it is either
   --  an integer or its numerator and denominator must be both smaller than
   --  the power 10**(Maxdigs - 1).

      --  i.e. if S = Num / Den, then S <= 1, in which case we can just
      --  compute the product Q = T * S.

      if Num >= Den then
         Scaled_Divide (T, Num, Den, Q, R, Round => False);

      --    D = Integer'Max (-Maxdigs, Scale - 1)

      --  then reason on Q if it is non-zero or else on R / Den.

      --  This works only if Den * 10**(-D) does not overflow, which is true
      --  if Den = 1. Suppose that Num corresponds to the maximum value of -D,
      --  i.e. Maxdigs and 10**(-D) = 10**Maxdigs. If you change Den into 10,
      --  then S becomes 10 times smaller and, therefore, Scale is incremented
      --  by 1, which means that -D is decremented by 1 provided that Scale was
      --  initially not smaller than 1 - Maxdigs, so the multiplication still
      --  does not overflow. But you need to reach 10 to trigger this effect,
      --  which means that a leeway of 10 is required, so let's restrict this
      --  to a Num for which 10**(-D) <= 10**(Maxdigs - 1). To sum up, if S is
      --  the ratio of two integers with

      --    1 < Den < Num <= B

      --  where B is a fixed limit, then the multiplication does not overflow.
      --  B can be taken as the largest integer Small such that D = 1 - Maxdigs
      --  i.e. such that Scale = 2 - Maxdigs, which is 10**(Maxdigs - 1) - 1.

--  This package is used to provide the default type for the
--  backward-compatibility Ada.Numerics.Aux interface.  This is
--  Long_Float for most platforms, but there is an alternate version
--  for x86 and x86_64 that uses the Long_Long_Float type.

--  This package should not be directly with'ed by an application program

with Ada.Numerics.Aux_Long_Float;
package Ada.Numerics.Aux_Compat renames Ada.Numerics.Aux_Long_Float;

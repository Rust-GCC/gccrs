--  This is the parent package for a library of useful units provided with GNAT

--  Note: this unit is used during bootstrap, see ADA_GENERATED_FILES in
--  gcc-interface/Make-lang.in for details on the constraints.

package GNAT is
   pragma Pure;

   --  The following type denotes the range of buckets for various hashed
   --  data structures in the GNAT unit hierarchy.

   type Bucket_Range_Type is mod 2 ** 32;

   --  The following exception is raised whenever an attempt is made to mutate
   --  the state of a data structure that is being iterated on.

   Iterated : exception;

   --  The following exception is raised when an iterator is exhausted and
   --  further attempts are made to advance it.

   Iterator_Exhausted : exception;

   --  The following exception is raised whenever an attempt is made to mutate
   --  the state of a data structure that has not been created yet.

   Not_Created : exception;

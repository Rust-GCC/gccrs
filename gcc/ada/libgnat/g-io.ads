--  A simple preelaborable subset of Text_IO capabilities

--  A simple text I/O package that can be used for simple I/O functions in
--  user programs as required. This package is also preelaborated, unlike
--  Text_IO, and can thus be with'ed by preelaborated library units.

--  Note that Data_Error is not raised by these subprograms for bad data.
--  If such checks are needed then the regular Text_IO package must be used.

package GNAT.IO is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   type File_Type is limited private;
   --  Specifies file to be used (the only possibilities are Standard_Output
   --  and Standard_Error). There is no Create or Open facility that would
   --  allow more general use of file names.

   function Standard_Error  return File_Type;
   --  These functions are the only way to get File_Type values

   procedure Get (X : out Integer);
   procedure Get (C : out Character);
   procedure Get_Line (Item : out String; Last : out Natural);
   --  These routines always read from Standard_Input

   procedure Put (File : File_Type; X : Integer);
   procedure Put (X : Integer);
   --  Output integer to specified file, or to current output file, same
   --  output as if Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO had been instantiated for Integer.

   procedure Put (File : File_Type; C : Character);
   procedure Put (C : Character);
   --  Output character to specified file, or to current output file

   procedure Put (File : File_Type; S : String);

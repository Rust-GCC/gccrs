   --  current call chain.
   --
   --    Traceback is an array of addresses where the result will be stored.
   --
   --    Max_Len is the length of the Traceback array. If the call chain is
   --    longer than this, then additional entries are discarded, and the
   --    traceback is missing some of the highest level entries.
   --
   --    Len is the number of addresses returned in the Traceback array
   --
   --    Exclude_Min/Exclude_Max, if non null, provide a range of addresses
   --    to ignore from the computation of the traceback.
   --
   --    Skip_Frames says how many of the most recent calls should at least
   --    be excluded from the result, regardless of the exclusion bounds and
   --    starting with this procedure itself: 1 means exclude the frame for
   --    this procedure, 2 means 1 + exclude the frame for this procedure's
   --    caller, ...
   --
   --  On return, the Traceback array is filled in, and Len indicates the
   --  number of stored entries. The first entry is the most recent call,
   --  and the last entry is the highest level call.

--  This package can be used to rewrite data on the fly. All occurrences of a
--  string (named pattern) will be replaced by another string.

--  It is not necessary to load all data in memory and so this package can be
--  used for large data chunks like disk files for example. The pattern is
--  a standard string and not a regular expression.

--  There is no dynamic allocation in the implementation.

--  For example, to replace all occurrences of "Gnat" with "GNAT":

--    Rewriter : Buffer := Create (Pattern => "Gnat", Value => "GNAT");

--  The output procedure that will receive the rewritten data:

--    procedure Do (Data : Stream_Element_Array) is
--    begin
--       <implementation to handle Data>
--    end Do;

--  Then:

--    Write (Rewriter, "Let's talk about Gnat compiler", Do'Access);
--    Write (Rewriter, "Gnat is an Ada compiler", Do'Access);
--    Flush (Rewriter, Do'Access);

--  Another possible usage is to specify a method to get the input data:

--    procedure Get
--      (Buffer : out Stream_Element_Array;
--       Last   : out Stream_Element_Offset)
--    is
--    begin
--       <get some data from a file, a socket, etc...>
--       Last := ...
--       Buffer := ...
--    end Get;

--  Then we can rewrite the whole file with:

--    Rewrite (Rewriter, Input => Get'Access, Output => Do'Access);

--  This unit exposes the Ada __m128 like data types to represent the contents
--  of SSE registers, for use by bindings to the SSE intrinsic operations.

--  See GNAT.SSE for the list of targets where this facility is supported

package GNAT.SSE.Vector_Types is

   --  The reference guide states a few usage guidelines for the C types:

   --    Since these new data types are not basic ANSI C data types, you
   --    must observe the following usage restrictions:
   --
   --     * Use new data types only on either side of an assignment, as a
   --       return value, or as a parameter. You cannot use it with other
   --       arithmetic expressions ("+", "-", and so on).
   --
   --     * Use new data types as objects in aggregates, such as unions to
   --       access the byte elements and structures.
   --
   --     * Use new data types only with the respective intrinsics described
   --       in this documentation.

   --  Each of the m128 types maps to a specific vector_type with an extra

   --  xmmintrin.h:

   --     with other vector types, and their scalar components.  */
   --  typedef float __m128
   --    __attribute__ ((__vector_size__ (16), __may_alias__));

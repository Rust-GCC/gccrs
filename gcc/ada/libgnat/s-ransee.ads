--  This package provide a seed for pseudo-random number generation using
--  the clock.

--  There are two separate implementations of this package:
--  o  one based on Ada.Calendar
--  o  one based on Ada.Real_Time

--  This is required because Ada.Calendar cannot be used on Ravenscar, but
--  Ada.Real_Time drags in the whole tasking runtime on regular platforms.

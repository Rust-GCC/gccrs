   --  This routine simply takes its argument and converts it to wide string
   --  format, storing the result in R (1 .. L), with L being set appropriately
   --  on return. The caller guarantees that R is long enough to accommodate
   --  the result. This is used in the context of the Wide_Image attribute,
   --  where the argument is the corresponding 'Image attribute. Any wide
   --  character escape sequences in the string are converted to the
   --  corresponding wide character value. No syntax checks are made, it is
   --  assumed that any such sequences are validly formed (this must be assured
   --  by the caller), and results from the fact that Wide_Image is only used
   --  on strings that have been built by the compiler, such as images of
   --  enumeration literals. If the method for encoding is a shift-in,
   --  shift-out convention, then it is assumed that normal (non-wide
   --  character) mode holds at the start and end of the argument string. EM
   --  indicates the wide character encoding method.
   --  Note: in the WCEM_Brackets case, the brackets escape sequence is used
   --  only for codes greater than 16#FF#.

--  Spelling checker

--  This package provides a utility generic routine for checking for bad
--  spellings. This routine must be instantiated with an appropriate array
--  element type, which must represent a character encoding in which the
--  codes for ASCII characters in the range 16#20#..16#7F# have their normal
--  expected encoding values (e.g. the Pos value 16#31# must be digit 1).

package GNAT.Spelling_Checker_Generic is
   pragma Pure;

   generic
      type Char_Type is (<>);
      --  See above for restrictions on what types can be used here

      type String_Type is array (Positive range <>) of Char_Type;

   function Is_Bad_Spelling_Of
     (Found  : String_Type;
      Expect : String_Type) return Boolean;
   --  Determines if the string Found is a plausible misspelling of the string
   --  Expect. Returns True for an exact match or a probably misspelling, False
   --  if no near match is detected. This routine is case sensitive, so the
   --  caller should fold both strings to get a case insensitive match if the
   --  character encoding represents upper/lower case.
   --
   --  Note: the spec of this routine is deliberately rather vague. This
   --  routine is the one used by GNAT itself to detect misspelled keywords
   --  and identifiers, and is heuristically adjusted to be appropriate to
   --  this usage. It will work well in any similar case of named entities.

   pragma Annotate (CodePeer, Skip_Analysis);

   --  This package is patterned after Ada.Containers.Indefinite_Holders. It is
   --  used to treat indefinite subtypes as definite, but without using heap
   --  allocation. For example, you might like to say:
   --
   --     type A is array (...) of T'Class; -- illegal
   --
   --  Instead, you can instantiate this package with Element_Type => T'Class,
   --  and say:
   --
   --     type A is array (...) of Holder;
   --
   --  Each object of type Holder is allocated Max_Size_In_Storage_Elements
   --  bytes. If you try to create a holder from an object of type Element_Type
   --  that is too big, an exception is raised (assuming assertions are
   --  enabled). This applies to To_Holder and Set. If you pass an Element_Type
   --  object that is smaller than Max_Size_In_Storage_Elements, it works fine,
   --  but some space is wasted.
   --
   --  NOTE: If assertions are disabled, and you try to use an Element that is
   --  too big, execution is erroneous, and anything can happen, such as
   --  overwriting arbitrary memory locations.
   --
   --  Element_Type must not be an unconstrained array type. It can be a
   --  class-wide type or a type with non-defaulted discriminants.
   --
   --  The 'Size of each Element_Type object must be a multiple of
   --  System.Storage_Unit; e.g. creating Holders from 5-bit objects won't
   --  work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--  This packages provides a special implementation of the Ada 95 storage pools

--  The goal of this debug pool is to detect incorrect uses of memory
--  (multiple deallocations, access to invalid memory,...). Errors are reported
--  in one of two ways: either by immediately raising an exception, or by
--  printing a message on standard output or standard error.

--  You need to instrument your code to use this package: for each access type
--  you want to monitor, you need to add a clause similar to:

--      type Integer_Access is access Integer;
--      for Integer_Access'Storage_Pool use Pool;

--  where Pool is a tagged object declared with
--
--      Pool : GNAT.Debug_Pools.Debug_Pool;

--  This package was designed to be as efficient as possible, but still has an
--  impact on the performance of your code, which depends on the number of
--  allocations, deallocations and, somewhat less, dereferences that your
--  application performs.

--  For each faulty memory use, this debug pool will print several lines
--  of information, including things like the location where the memory
--  was initially allocated, the location where it was freed etc.

--  Physical allocations and deallocations are done through the usual system
--  calls. However, in order to provide proper checks, the debug pool will not
--  release the memory immediately. It keeps released memory around (the amount
--  kept around is configurable) so that it can distinguish between memory that
--  has not been allocated and memory that has been allocated but freed. This
--  also means that this memory cannot be reallocated, preventing what would
--  otherwise be a false indication that freed memory is now allocated.

--  In addition, this package presents several subprograms that help analyze
--  the behavior of your program, by reporting memory leaks, the total amount
--  of memory that was allocated. The pool is also designed to work correctly
--  in conjunction with gnatmem.

--  Finally, a subprogram Print_Pool is provided for use from the debugger

--  Limitations
--  ===========

--  Current limitation of this debug pool: if you use this debug pool for a
--  general access type ("access all"), the pool might report invalid
--  dereferences if the access object is pointing to another object on the
--  stack which was not allocated through a call to "new".

--  This debug pool will respect all alignments specified in your code, but
--  it does that by aligning all objects using Standard'Maximum_Alignment.
--  This allows faster checks, and limits the performance impact of using
--  this pool.

   --    Stack_Trace_Depth. This parameter controls the maximum depth of stack
   --    traces that are output to indicate locations of actions for error
   --    conditions such as bad allocations. If set to zero, the debug pool
   --    will not try to compute backtraces. This is more efficient but gives
   --    less information on problem locations (and in particular, this
   --    disables the tracking of the biggest users of memory).
   --
   --    Maximum_Logically_Freed_Memory: maximum amount of memory (bytes)
   --    that should be kept before starting to physically deallocate some.
   --    This value should be non-zero, since having memory that is logically
   --    but not physically freed helps to detect invalid memory accesses.
   --
   --    Minimum_To_Free is the minimum amount of memory that should be freed
   --    every time the pool starts physically releasing memory. The algorithm
   --    to compute which block should be physically released needs some
   --    expensive initialization (see Advanced_Scanning below), and this
   --    parameter can be used to limit the performance impact by ensuring
   --    that a reasonable amount of memory is freed each time. Even in the
   --    advanced scanning mode, marked blocks may be released to match this
   --    Minimum_To_Free parameter.
   --
   --    Reset_Content_On_Free: If true, then the contents of the freed memory
   --    is reset to the pattern 16#DEADBEEF#, following an old IBM convention.
   --    This helps in detecting invalid memory references from the debugger.
   --
   --    Raise_Exceptions: If true, the exceptions below will be raised every
   --    time an error is detected. If you set this to False, then the action
   --    is to generate output on standard error or standard output, depending
   --    on Errors_To_Stdout, noting the errors, but to
   --    keep running if possible (of course if storage is badly damaged, this
   --    attempt may fail. This helps to detect more than one error in a run.
   --
   --    Advanced_Scanning: If true, the pool will check the contents of all
   --    allocated blocks before physically releasing memory. Any possible
   --    reference to a logically free block will prevent its deallocation.
   --    Note that this algorithm is approximate, and it is recommended
   --    that you set Minimum_To_Free to a non-zero value to save time.
   --
   --    Errors_To_Stdout: Errors messages will be displayed on stdout if
   --    this parameter is True, or to stderr otherwise.
   --
   --    Low_Level_Traces: Traces all allocation and deallocations on the
   --    stream specified by Errors_To_Stdout. This can be used for
   --    post-processing by your own application, or to debug the
   --    debug_pool itself. The output indicates the size of the allocated
   --    block both as requested by the application and as physically
   --    allocated to fit the additional information needed by the debug
   --    pool.
   --
   --  All instantiations of this pool use the same internal tables. However,
   --  they do not store the same amount of information for the tracebacks,
   --  and they have different counters for maximum logically freed memory.

   Accessing_Not_Allocated_Storage : exception;
   --  Exception raised if Raise_Exception is True, and an attempt is made
   --  to access storage that was never allocated.

   Accessing_Deallocated_Storage : exception;
   --  Exception raised if Raise_Exception is True, and an attempt is made
   --  to access storage that was allocated but has been deallocated.

   Freeing_Not_Allocated_Storage : exception;

   Freeing_Deallocated_Storage : exception;
   --  Exception raised if Raise_Exception is True, and an attempt is made

   --  Note on the above exceptions. The distinction between not allocated
   --  and deallocated storage is not guaranteed to be accurate in the case
   --  where storage is allocated, and then physically freed. Larger values
   --  of the parameter Maximum_Logically_Freed_Memory will help to guarantee

--  This package contains the routines for Ada.Text_IO.Float_IO that are
--  shared among separate instantiations of this package. The routines in
--  this package are identical semantically to those in Float_IO, except
--  that the default parameters have been removed because they are supplied
--  explicitly by the calls from within the generic template. This package
--  is also used by Ada.Text_IO.Fixed_IO and Ada.Text_IO.Decimal_IO.

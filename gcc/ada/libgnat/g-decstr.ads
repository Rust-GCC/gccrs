--  This generic package provides utility routines for converting from an
--  encoded string to a corresponding Wide_String or Wide_Wide_String value
--  using a specified encoding convention, which is supplied as the generic
--  parameter. UTF-8 is handled especially efficiently, and if the encoding
--  method is known at compile time to be WCEM_UTF8, then the instantiation
--  is specialized to handle only the UTF-8 case and exclude code for the
--  other encoding methods. The package also provides positioning routines
--  for skipping encoded characters in either direction, and for validating
--  strings for correct encodings.

--  Note: this package is only about decoding sequences of 8-bit characters
--  into corresponding 16-bit Wide_String or 32-bit Wide_Wide_String values.
--  It knows nothing at all about the character encodings being used for the
--  resulting Wide_Character and Wide_Wide_Character values. Most often this
--  will be Unicode/ISO-10646 as specified by the Ada RM, but this package
--  does not make any assumptions about the character coding. See also the
--  packages Ada.Wide_[Wide_]Characters.Unicode for unicode specific functions.

--  In particular, in the case of UTF-8, all valid UTF-8 encodings, as listed
--  in table 3.6 of the Unicode Standard, version 6.2.0, are recognized as
--  legitimate. This includes the full range 16#0000_0000# .. 16#03FF_FFFF#.
--  This includes codes in the range 16#D800# - 16#DFFF#. These codes all
--  have UTF-8 encoding sequences that are well-defined (e.g. the encoding for
--  16#D800# is ED A0 80). But these codes do not correspond to defined Unicode
--  characters and are thus considered to be "not well-formed" (see table 3.7
--  of the Unicode Standard). If you need to exclude these codes, you must do
--  that manually, e.g. use Decode_Wide_Character/Decode_Wide_String and check
--  that the resulting code(s) are not in this range.

--  Note on the use of brackets encoding (WCEM_Brackets). The brackets encoding
--  method is ambiguous in the context of this package, since there is no way
--  to tell if ["1234"] is eight unencoded characters or one encoded character.
--  In the context of Ada sources, any sequence starting [" must be the start
--  of an encoding (since that sequence is not valid in Ada source otherwise).
--  The routines in this package use the same approach. If the input string
--  contains the sequence [" then this is assumed to be the start of a brackets
--  encoding sequence, and if it does not match the syntax, an error is raised.
--  In the case of the Prev functions, a sequence ending with "] is assumed to
--  be a valid brackets sequence, and an error is raised if it is not.

   --  skipped is not a valid Wide_Character code.

   procedure Prev_Wide_Character (Input : String; Ptr : in out Natural);

   --  backwards in the string, so that on return, Ptr is set to point to the
   --  previous encoded character. Constraint_Error is raised if the start of

   --  of UTF-8 (Encoding_Method = WCEM_UTF8) and Brackets (Encoding_Method =
   --  WCEM_Brackets). For all other encodings, we work by starting at the
   --  beginning of the string and moving forward till Ptr is reached, which
   --  is correct but slow.

   --  Note: this routine assumes that the sequence prior to Ptr is correctly
   --  encoded, it does not have a defined behavior if this is not the case.

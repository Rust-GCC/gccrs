--  This unit provides software routines for doing arithmetic on 32-bit
--  signed integer values in cases where either overflow checking is
--  required, or intermediate results are longer than 32 bits.

--  Preconditions in this unit are meant for analysis only, not for run-time
--  checking, so that the expected exceptions are raised. This is enforced
--  by setting the corresponding assertion policy to Ignore. Postconditions
--  and contract cases should not be executed at runtime as well, in order
--  not to slow down the execution of these functions.

--  A routine for dumping memory to either standard output or standard error.
--  Uses GNAT.IO for actual output (use the controls in GNAT.IO to specify
--  the destination of the output, which by default is Standard_Output).

   type Prefix_Type is (Absolute_Address, Offset, None);

   procedure Dump
     (Addr   : System.Address;
      Count  : Natural);
   --  Dumps indicated number (Count) of bytes, starting at the address given
   --  by Addr. The coding of this routine in its current form assumes the case
   --  of a byte addressable machine (and is therefore inapplicable to machines
   --  where the storage unit is not 8 bits). The output is one or more lines
   --  in the following format, which is for the case of 32-bit addresses
   --  (64-bit addresses are handled appropriately):
   --
   --    0234_3368: 66 67 68 . . .  73 74 75 "fghijklmnopqstuv"
   --
   --  All but the last line have 16 bytes. A question mark is used in the
   --  string data to indicate a non-printable character.

   procedure Dump
     (Addr   : System.Address;
      Count  : Natural;
      Prefix : Prefix_Type);
   --  Same as above, but allows the selection of different line formats.
   --  If Prefix is set to Absolute_Address, the output is identical to the
   --  above version, each line starting with the absolute address of the
   --  first dumped storage element.
   --
   --  If Prefix is set to Offset, then instead each line starts with the
   --  indication of the offset relative to Addr:
   --
   --    00: 66 67 68 . . .  73 74 75 "fghijklmnopqstuv"
   --
   --  Finally if Prefix is set to None, the prefix is suppressed altogether,
   --  and only the memory contents are displayed:
   --
   --    66 67 68 . . .  73 74 75 "fghijklmnopqstuv"

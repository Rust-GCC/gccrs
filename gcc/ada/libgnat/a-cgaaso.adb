--  providing the same feature, Ada.Containers.Generic_Sort, was defined for
--  Ada 2012.  We retain Generic_Anonymous_Array_Sort for compatibility, but
--  implement it in terms of the official unit, Generic_Sort.

   procedure Sort is new Ada.Containers.Generic_Sort

      Before     => Less,
      Swap       => Swap);

   Sort (First, Last);

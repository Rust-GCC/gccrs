--  This package provides the basic computational interface for the
--  generic elementary functions. With the intrinsic version, the
--  compiler can use its knowledge of the functions to select the most
--  suitable implementation. It is thus quite portable. These
--  interfaces are suitable for cases in which Long Long Float and C's
--  long double share the same representation.

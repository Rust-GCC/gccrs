--  This function performs exponentiation of a modular type with nonbinary
--  modulus values. Arithmetic is done in Long_Long_Unsigned, with explicit
--  accounting for the modulus value which is passed as the second argument.
--  Note that 1 is a binary modulus (2**0), so the compiler should not (and
--  will not) call this function with Modulus equal to 1.

--  Preconditions in this unit are meant for analysis only, not for run-time
--  checking, so that the expected exceptions are raised. This is enforced by
--  setting the corresponding assertion policy to Ignore. Postconditions and
--  contract cases should not be executed at runtime as well, in order not to
--  slow down the execution of these functions.

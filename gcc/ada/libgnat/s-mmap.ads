--  This package provides memory mapping of files. Depending on your operating
--  system, this might provide a more efficient method for accessing the
--  contents of files.
--  A description of memory-mapping is available on the sqlite page, at:
--      http://www.sqlite.org/mmap.html
--
--  The traditional method for reading a file is to allocate a buffer in the
--  application address space, then open the file and copy its contents. When
--  memory mapping is available though, the application asks the operating
--  system to return a pointer to the requested page, if possible. If the
--  requested page has been or can be mapped into the application address
--  space, the system returns a pointer to that page for the application to
--  use without having to copy anything. Skipping the copy step is what makes
--  memory mapped I/O faster.
--
--  When memory mapping is not available, this package automatically falls
--  back to the traditional copy method.
--
--  Example of use for this package, when reading a file that can be fully
--  mapped
--
--  declare
--     File : Mapped_File;
--     Str  : Str_Access;
--  begin
--     File := Open_Read ("/tmp/file_on_disk");
--     Read (File);  --  read the whole file
--     Str := Data (File);
--     for S in 1 .. Last (File) loop
--         Put (Str (S));
--     end loop;
--     Close (File);
--  end;
--
--  When the file is big, or you only want to access part of it at a given
--  time, you can use the following type of code.

--  declare
--     File   : Mapped_File;
--     Str    : Str_Access;
--     Offs   : File_Size := 0;
--     Page   : constant Integer := Get_Page_Size;
--  begin
--     File := Open_Read ("/tmp/file_on_disk");
--     while Offs < Length (File) loop
--         Read (File, Offs, Length => Long_Integer (Page) * 4);
--         Str := Data (File);
--
--         --  Print characters for this chunk:
--         for S in Integer (Offs - Offset (File)) + 1 .. Last (File) loop
--            Put (Str (S));
--         end loop;
--
--         --  Since we are reading multiples of Get_Page_Size, we can simplify
--         --  with
--         --    for S in 1 .. Last (File) loop ...
--
--         Offs := Offs + Long_Integer (Last (File));
--     end loop;

package System.Mmap is

   type Mapped_File is private;
   --  File to be mapped in memory.

   --  This package will use the fastest possible algorithm to load the
   --  file in memory. On systems that support it, the file is not really
   --  loaded in memory. Instead, a call to the mmap() system call (or
   --  CreateFileMapping()) will keep the file on disk, but make it
   --  accessible as if it was in memory.

   --  When the system does not support it, the file is actually loaded in
   --  memory through calls to read(), and written back with write() when you
   --  close it. This is of course much slower.

   --  Legacy: each mapped file has a "default" mapped region in it.

   type Mapped_Region is private;
   --  A representation of part of a file in memory. Actual reading/writing
   --  is done through a mapped region. After being returned by Read, a mapped
   --  region must be free'd when done. If the original Mapped_File was open
   --  for reading, it can be closed before the mapped region is free'd.

   --  Read a specific part of File and set Region to the corresponding mapped
   --  region, or re-use it if possible.
   --  Offset is the number of bytes since the beginning of the file at which
   --  we should start reading. Length is the number of bytes that should be
   --  read. If set to 0, as much of the file as possible is read (presumably
   --  the whole file unless you are reading a _huge_ file).
   --  Note that no (un)mapping is is done if that part of the file is already
   --  available through Region.
   --  If the file was opened for writing, any modification you do to the
   --  data stored in File will be stored on disk (either immediately when the
   --  file is opened through a mmap() system call, or when the file is closed
   --  otherwise).
   --  Mutable is processed only for reading files. If set to True, the
   --  data can be modified, even through it will not be carried through the
   --  underlying file, nor it is guaranteed to be carried through remapping.
   --  This function takes care of page size alignment issues. The accessors

   function Get_Page_Size return Integer;
   --  Returns the number of bytes in a page. Once a file is mapped from the
   --  disk, its offset and Length should be multiples of this page size (which
   --  is ensured by this package in any case). Knowing this page size allows

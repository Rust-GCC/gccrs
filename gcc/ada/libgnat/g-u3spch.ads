--  Spelling checker

--  This package provides a utility routine for checking for bad spellings
--  for the case of System.WCh_Cnv.UTF_32_String arguments.

with System.WCh_Cnv;

package GNAT.UTF_32_Spelling_Checker is
   pragma Pure;

   function Is_Bad_Spelling_Of
     (Found  : System.WCh_Cnv.UTF_32_String;
      Expect : System.WCh_Cnv.UTF_32_String) return Boolean;
   --  Determines if the string Found is a plausible misspelling of the string
   --  Expect. Returns True for an exact match or a probably misspelling, False
   --  if no near match is detected. This routine is case sensitive, so the
   --  caller should fold both strings to get a case insensitive match.
   --
   --  Note: the spec of this routine is deliberately rather vague. It is used
   --  by GNAT itself to detect misspelled keywords and identifiers, and is
   --  heuristically adjusted to be appropriate to this usage. It will work
   --  well in any similar case of named entities.

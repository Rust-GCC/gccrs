--  Operations on packed bit strings

package System.Bit_Ops is

   --  Note: in all the following routines, the System.Address parameters
   --  represent the address of the first byte of an array used to represent
   --  a packed array (of type System.Unsigned_Types.Packed_Bytes{1,2,4})
   --  The length in bits is passed as a separate parameter. Note that all
   --  addresses must be of byte aligned arrays.

   procedure Bit_And
     (Left   : System.Address;
      Llen   : Natural;
      Right  : System.Address;
      Rlen   : Natural;
      Result : System.Address);
   --  Bitwise "and" of given bit string with result being placed in Result.
   --  The and operation is allowed to destroy unused bits in the last byte,
   --  i.e. to leave them set in an undefined manner. Note that Left, Right
   --  and Result always have the same length in bits (Len).

   function Bit_Eq
     (Left  : System.Address;
      Llen  : Natural;
      Right : System.Address;
      Rlen  : Natural) return Boolean;
   --  Left and Right are the addresses of two bit packed arrays with Llen
   --  and Rlen being the respective length in bits. The routine compares the
   --  two bit strings for equality, being careful not to include the unused
   --  bits in the final byte. Note that the result is always False if Rlen
   --  is not equal to Llen.

   procedure Bit_Not
     (Opnd   : System.Address;
      Len    : Natural;
      Result : System.Address);
   --  Bitwise "not" of given bit string with result being placed in Result.
   --  The not operation is allowed to destroy unused bits in the last byte,
   --  i.e. to leave them set in an undefined manner. Note that Result and
   --  Opnd always have the same length in bits (Len).

   procedure Bit_Or
     (Left   : System.Address;
      Llen   : Natural;
      Right  : System.Address;
      Rlen   : Natural;
      Result : System.Address);
   --  Bitwise "or" of given bit string with result being placed in Result.
   --  The or operation is allowed to destroy unused bits in the last byte,
   --  i.e. to leave them set in an undefined manner. Note that Left, Right
   --  and Result always have the same length in bits (Len).

   procedure Bit_Xor
     (Left   : System.Address;
      Llen   : Natural;
      Right  : System.Address;
      Rlen   : Natural;
      Result : System.Address);
   --  Bitwise "xor" of given bit string with result being placed in Result.
   --  The xor operation is allowed to destroy unused bits in the last byte,
   --  i.e. to leave them set in an undefined manner. Note that Left, Right
   --  and Result always have the same length in bits (Len).

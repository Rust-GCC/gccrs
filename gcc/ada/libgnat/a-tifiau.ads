--  This package contains the implementation for Ada.Text_IO.Fixed_IO. The
--  routines in this package are identical semantically to those in Fixed_IO,
--  except that the default parameters have been removed because they are
--  supplied explicitly by the calls from within these units, and there are
--  additional Num and Den parameters giving the value of Num'Small, as well
--  as For0 and Aft0 giving some properties of Num'Small. In addition the Get
--  routines return the value rather than store it in an Out parameter.

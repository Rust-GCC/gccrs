--  This package provides supporting code for implementation of the following

--  SHA-384, SHA-512. It contains the generic transform operation that is
--  common to the above four functions. The complete text of FIPS PUB 180-3
--  can be found at:
--    http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-3/fips180-3_final.pdf

--  This is an internal unit and should not be used directly in applications.
--  Use GNAT.SHA* instead.

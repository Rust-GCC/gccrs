--  Note that the reason for treating exponents in the range 0 .. 4 specially
--  is to ensure identical results with the static expansion in the case of a
--  compile-time known exponent in this range; similarly, the use 'Machine is
--  to avoid unwanted extra precision in the results.

--  For a negative exponent, we compute the result as per RM 4.5.6(11/3):

--     Left ** Right = 1.0 / (Left ** (-Right))

--  Note that the case of Left being zero is not special, it will simply result
--  in a division by zero at the end, yielding a correctly signed infinity, or
--  possibly raising an overflow exception.

--  Note on overflow: this coding assumes that the target generates infinities
--  with standard IEEE semantics. If this is not the case, then the code for
--  negative exponents may raise Constraint_Error, which is in keeping with the
--  implementation permission given in RM 4.5.6(12).

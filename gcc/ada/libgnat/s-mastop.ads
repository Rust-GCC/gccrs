package System.Machine_State_Operations is

   subtype Code_Loc is System.Address;
   --  Code location used in building exception tables and for call addresses
   --  when propagating an exception (also traceback table) Values of this
   --  type are created by using Label'Address or extracted from machine
   --  states using Get_Code_Loc.

   type Machine_State is new System.Address;
   --  The table based exception handling approach (see a-except.adb) isolates
   --  the target dependent aspects using an abstract data type interface
   --  to the type Machine_State, which is represented as a System.Address
   --  value (presumably implemented as a pointer to an appropriate record
   --  structure).

   function Machine_State_Length return System.Storage_Elements.Storage_Offset;
   --  Function to determine the length of the Storage_Array needed to hold
   --  a machine state. The machine state will always be maximally aligned.
   --  The value returned is a constant that will be used to allocate space
   --  for a machine state value.

   function Allocate_Machine_State return Machine_State;
   --  Allocate the required space for a Machine_State

   procedure Free_Machine_State (M : in out Machine_State);
   --  Free the dynamic memory taken by Machine_State

   --  The initial value of type Machine_State is created by the low level
   --  routine that actually raises an exception using the special builtin
   --  _builtin_machine_state. This value will typically encode the value of
   --  the program counter, and relevant registers. The following operations
   --  are defined on Machine_State values:

   function Get_Code_Loc (M : Machine_State) return Code_Loc;
   --  This function extracts the program counter value from a machine state,
   --  which the caller uses for searching the exception tables, and also for
   --  recording entries in the traceback table. The call returns a value of
   --  Null_Loc if the machine state represents the outer level, or some other
   --  frame for which no information can be provided.

   procedure Pop_Frame (M : Machine_State);
   --  This procedure pops the machine state M so that it represents the
   --  call point, as though the current subprogram had returned. It changes
   --  only the value referenced by M, and does not affect the current stack
   --  environment.

   function Fetch_Code (Loc : Code_Loc) return Code_Loc;
   --  Some architectures (notably HPUX) use a descriptor to describe a
   --  subprogram address. This function computes the actual starting
   --  address of the code from Loc.
   --
   --  Do not add pragma Inline to this function: there is a curious
   --  interaction between rtsfind and front-end inlining. The exception
   --  declaration in s-auxdec calls rtsfind, which forces several other system
   --  packages to be compiled. Some of those have a pragma Inline, and we
   --  compile the corresponding bodies so that inlining can take place. One
   --  of these packages is s-mastop, which depends on s-auxdec, which is still
   --  being compiled: we have not seen all the declarations in it yet, so we
   --  get confused semantic errors ???

   procedure Set_Machine_State (M : Machine_State);
   --  This routine sets M from the current machine state. It is called when an
   --  exception is initially signalled to initialize the state.

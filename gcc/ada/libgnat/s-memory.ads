--  This package provides the low level memory allocation/deallocation
--  mechanisms used by GNAT.

--  To provide an alternate implementation, simply recompile the modified
--  body of this package with gnatmake -u -a -g s-memory.adb and make sure
--  that the ali and object files for this unit are found in the object
--  search path.

--  This unit may be used directly from an application program by providing
--  an appropriate WITH, and the interface can be expected to remain stable.

package System.Memory is
   pragma Elaborate_Body;

   type size_t is mod 2 ** Standard'Address_Size;
   --  Note: the reason we redefine this here instead of using the
   --  definition in Interfaces.C is that we do not want to drag in
   --  all of Interfaces.C just because System.Memory is used.

   function Alloc (Size : size_t) return System.Address;
   --  This is the low level allocation routine. Given a size in storage
   --  units, it returns the address of a maximally aligned block of
   --  memory. The implementation of this routine is guaranteed to be
   --  task safe, and also aborts are deferred if necessary.
   --
   --  If Size is set to size_t'Last on entry, then a Storage_Error
   --  exception is raised with a message "object too large".
   --
   --  If Size is set to zero on entry, then a minimal (but non-zero)
   --  size block is allocated.
   --
   --  Note: this is roughly equivalent to the standard C malloc call
   --  with the additional semantics as described above.

   procedure Free (Ptr : System.Address);
   --  This is the low level free routine. It frees a block previously
   --  allocated with a call to Alloc. As in the case of Alloc, this
   --  call is guaranteed task safe, and aborts are deferred.
   --
   --  Note: this is roughly equivalent to the standard C free call
   --  with the additional semantics as described above.

   function Realloc
     (Ptr  : System.Address;
      Size : size_t) return System.Address;
   --  This is the low level reallocation routine. It takes an existing
   --  block address returned by a previous call to Alloc or Realloc,
   --  and reallocates the block. The size can either be increased or
   --  decreased. If possible the reallocation is done in place, so that
   --  the returned result is the same as the value of Ptr on entry.
   --  However, it may be necessary to relocate the block to another
   --  address, in which case the information is copied to the new
   --  block, and the old block is freed. The implementation of this
   --  routine is guaranteed to be task safe, and also aborts are
   --  deferred as necessary.
   --
   --  If Size is set to size_t'Last on entry, then a Storage_Error
   --  exception is raised with a message "object too large".
   --
   --  If Size is set to zero on entry, then a minimal (but non-zero)
   --  size block is allocated.
   --
   --  Note: this is roughly equivalent to the standard C realloc call
   --  with the additional semantics as described above.

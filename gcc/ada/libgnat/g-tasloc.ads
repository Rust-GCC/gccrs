--  Simple task lock and unlock routines

--  A small package containing a task lock and unlock routines for creating
--  a critical region. The lock involved is a global lock, shared by all
--  tasks, and by all calls to these routines, so these routines should be
--  used with care to avoid unnecessary reduction of concurrency.

--  These routines may be used in a non-tasking program, and in that case
--  they have no effect (they do NOT cause the tasking runtime to be loaded).

--  See file s-tasloc.ads for full documentation of the interface

with System.Task_Lock;

package GNAT.Task_Lock renames System.Task_Lock;

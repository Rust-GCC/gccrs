      --  The head of the free list is indicated by Container.Free. If its
      --  value is non-negative, then the free store has been initialized
      --  in the "normal" way: Container.Free points to the head of the list

      --  to the next free node (via its Parent component), and the value 0
      --  means that this is the last free node.

      --  becomes inactive, and so we set its Next component to value of

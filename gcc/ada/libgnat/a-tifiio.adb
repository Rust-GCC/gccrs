--  - Fixed point I/O -
--  -------------------

--  The following text documents implementation details of the fixed point
--  input/output routines in the GNAT runtime. The first part describes the
--  general properties of fixed point types as defined by the Ada standard,
--  including the Information Systems Annex.

--  Subsequently these are reduced to implementation constraints and the impact
--  of these constraints on a few possible approaches to input/output is given.
--  Based on this analysis, a specific implementation is selected for use in
--  the GNAT runtime. Finally the chosen algorithms are analyzed numerically in
--  order to provide user-level documentation on limits for range and precision
--  of fixed point types as well as accuracy of input/output conversions.

--  -------------------------------------------
--  - General Properties of Fixed Point Types -
--  -------------------------------------------

--  Operations on fixed point types, other than input/output, are not important
--  for the purpose of this document. Only the set of values that a fixed point
--  type can represent and the input/output operations are significant.

--  Values
--  ------

--  The set of values of a fixed point type comprise the integral multiples of
--  a number called the small of the type. The small can be either a power of
--  two, a power of ten or (if the implementation allows) an arbitrary strictly
--  positive real value.

--  Implementations need to support ordinary fixed point types with a precision
--  of at least 24 bits, and (in order to comply with the Information Systems
--  Annex) decimal fixed point types with at least 18 digits. For the rest, no
--  requirements exist for the minimal small and range that must be supported.

--  Operations
--  ----------

--  [Wide_[Wide_]]Image attribute (see RM 3.5(27.1/2))

--          These attributes return a decimal real literal best approximating
--          the value (rounded away from zero if halfway between) with a
--          single leading character that is either a minus sign or a space,
--          one or more digits before the decimal point (with no redundant
--          leading zeros), a decimal point, and N digits after the decimal
--          point. For a subtype S, the value of N is S'Aft, the smallest
--          positive integer such that (10**N)*S'Delta is greater or equal to
--          one, see RM 3.5.10(5).

--          For an arbitrary small, this means large number arithmetic needs
--          to be performed.

--  Put (see RM A.10.9(22-26))

--          The requirements for Put add no extra constraints over the image
--          attributes, although it would be nice to be able to output more
--          than S'Aft digits after the decimal point for values of subtype S.

--  [Wide_[Wide_]]Value attribute (RM 3.5(39.1/2))

--          Since the input can be given in any base in the range 2..16,
--          accurate conversion to a fixed point number may require
--          arbitrary precision arithmetic if there is no limit on the
--          magnitude of the small of the fixed point type.

--  Get (see RM A.10.9(12-21))

--          The requirements for Get are identical to those of the Value
--          attribute.

--  ------------------------------
--  - Implementation Constraints -
--  ------------------------------

--  The requirements listed above for the input/output operations lead to
--  significant complexity, if no constraints are put on supported smalls.

--  Implementation Strategies
--  -------------------------

--  * Floating point arithmetic
--  * Arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic
--  * Fixed-precision integer arithmetic

--  Although it seems convenient to convert fixed point numbers to floating
--  point and then print them, this leads to a number of restrictions.
--  The first one is precision. The widest floating-point type generally
--  available has 53 bits of mantissa. This means that Fine_Delta cannot
--  be less than 2.0**(-53).

--  In GNAT, Fine_Delta is 2.0**(-63), and Duration for example is a 64-bit
--  type. This means that a floating-point type with 64 bits of mantissa needs
--  to be used, which is only generally available on the x86 architecture. It
--  would still be possible to use multi-precision floating point to perform
--  calculations using longer mantissas, but this is a much harder approach.

--  The base conversions needed for input/output of (non-decimal) fixed point
--  types can be seen as pairs of integer multiplications and divisions.

--  Arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic would be suitable for the job at
--  hand, but has the drawback that it is very heavy implementation-wise.
--  Especially in embedded systems, where fixed point types are often used,
--  it may not be desirable to require large amounts of storage and time
--  for fixed I/O operations.

--  Fixed-precision integer arithmetic has the advantage of simplicity and
--  speed. For the most common fixed point types this would be a perfect
--  solution. The downside however may be a restricted set of acceptable
--  fixed point types.

--  Implementation Choices
--  ----------------------

--  The current implementation in the GNAT runtime uses fixed-precision integer
--  arithmetic for fixed point types whose Small is the ratio of two integers
--  whose magnitude is bounded relatively to the size of the mantissa, with a
--  two-tiered approach for 32-bit and 64-bit fixed point types. For the other
--  fixed point types, the implementation uses floating-point arithmetic.

--  The exact requirements of the algorithms are analyzed and documented along
--  with the implementation in their respective units.

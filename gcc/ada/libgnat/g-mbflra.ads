--  The implementation used in this package was contributed by

--  M. Shub, SIAM Journal of Computing, Vol 15. No 2, May 1986. The
--  particular choices for P and Q chosen here guarantee a period of
--  562,085,314,430,582 (about 2**49), and the generated sequence has
--  excellent randomness properties. For further details, see the
--  paper "Fast Generation of Trustworthy Random Numbers", by Robert
--  Eachus, which describes both the algorithm and the efficient
--  implementation approach used here.

--  Formerly, this package was Ada.Numerics.Float_Random. It is retained
--  here in part to allow users to reconstruct number sequences generated
--  by previous versions.

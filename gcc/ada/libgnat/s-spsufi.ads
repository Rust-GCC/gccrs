package System.Storage_Pools.Subpools.Finalization is

   --  The pragma is needed because package System.Storage_Pools.Subpools which
   --  is already preelaborated now depends on this unit.

   pragma Preelaborate;

   procedure Finalize_And_Deallocate (Subpool : in out Subpool_Handle);
   --  This routine performs the following actions:
   --    1) Finalize all objects chained on the subpool's master
   --    2) Remove the subpool from the owner's list of subpools
   --    3) Deallocate the doubly linked list node associated with the subpool
   --    4) Call Deallocate_Subpool

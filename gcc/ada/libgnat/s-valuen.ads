   --  Used to compute Enum'Value (Str) where Enum is some enumeration type
   --  other than those defined in package Standard. Names is a string with
   --  a lower bound of 1 containing the characters of all the enumeration
   --  literals concatenated together in sequence. Indexes is the address
   --  of an array of type array (0 .. N) of Index_Type, where N is the
   --  number of enumeration literals in the type. The Indexes values are
   --  the starting subscript of each enumeration literal, indexed by Pos
   --  values, with an extra entry at the end containing Names'Length + 1.
   --  The parameter Hash is a (perfect) hash function for Names and Indexes.
   --  The parameter Num is the value N - 1 (i.e. Enum'Pos (Enum'Last)).
   --  The reason that Indexes is passed by address is that the actual type
   --  is created on the fly by the expander.

   --  Str is the argument of the attribute function, and may have leading
   --  and trailing spaces, and letters can be upper or lower case or mixed.
   --  If the image is found in Names, then the corresponding Pos value is
   --  returned. If not, Constraint_Error is raised.

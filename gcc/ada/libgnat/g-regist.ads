--  The registry is a Windows database to store key/value pair. It is used
--  to keep Windows operation system and applications configuration options.
--  The database is a hierarchal set of key and for each key a value can
--  be associated. This package provides high level routines to deal with
--  the Windows registry. For full registry API, but at a lower level of
--  abstraction, refer to the Win32.Winreg package provided with the
--  Win32Ada binding. For example this binding handle only key values of
--  type Standard.String.

--  This package is specific to the NT version of GNAT, and is not available
--  on any other platforms.

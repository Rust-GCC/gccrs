--  This version of this package is for implementations which use
--  the stack limit approach (the limit of the stack is stored into a per
--  thread variable).

pragma Restrictions (No_Elaboration_Code);
--  We want to guarantee the absence of elaboration code because the binder
--  does not handle references to this package.

package System.Stack_Checking.Operations is
   pragma Preelaborate;

   procedure Initialize_Stack_Limit;
   pragma Export (C, Initialize_Stack_Limit,
                    "__gnat_initialize_stack_limit");
   --  This procedure is called before elaboration to setup the stack limit
   --  for the environment task and to register the hook to be called at
   --  task creation.

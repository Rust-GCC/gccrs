pragma Pure (Ada.Strings.Equal_Case_Insensitive);
--  Performs a case-insensitive equality test of Left and Right. This is
--  useful as the generic actual equivalence operation (Equivalent_Keys)
--  when instantiating a hashed container package with type String as the
--  key. It is also useful as the generic actual equality operator when
--  instantiating a container package with type String as the element,
--  allowing case-insensitive container equality tests.

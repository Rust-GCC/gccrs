   --  The high-level idea of the implementation is to overlay a record
   --  containing components of the same size as that of the component
   --  of the array, in order words 67 bits, and to access the indexed
   --  component of the array through the appropriate selected component
   --  of the record.

   --  The record must be of a fixed size for technical reasons, so we
   --  effectively overlay a series of contiguous records containing 8
   --  components (so that their size in bits is a multiple of a byte)
   --  at the start of the array and access the component in the last
   --  of them. However, this component in the last record may also be
   --  mapped to the last component of the array, which means that the
   --  generated code cannot safely access past it (or its last byte).
   --  That's why the last record of the series is shortened, so the
   --  accessed component is always the last component of the record.

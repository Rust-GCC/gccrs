--  This package defines a datatype which is most efficient for performing
--  logical operations on large arrays. See System.Generic_Vector_Operations.

--  In the future this package may also define operations such as element-wise
--  addition, subtraction, multiplication, minimum and maximum of vector-sized
--  packed arrays of Unsigned_8, Unsigned_16 and Unsigned_32 values. These
--  operations could be implemented as system intrinsics on platforms with
--  direct processor support for them.

package System.Vectors is
   pragma Pure;

   type Vector is mod 2**System.Word_Size;
   for Vector'Alignment use Integer'Min
     (Standard'Maximum_Alignment, System.Word_Size / System.Storage_Unit);
   for Vector'Size use System.Word_Size;

end System.Vectors;

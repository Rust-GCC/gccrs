-- Dimension Terminology --
---------------------------

--  * Dimensioned type

--    A dimensioned type is a type (more accurately a first subtype) to which
--    the aspect Dimension_System applies to.

--      type Mks_Type is new Long_Long_Float
--        with
--         Dimension_System => (
--          (Unit_Name => Meter,    Unit_Symbol => 'm',   Dim_Symbol => 'L'),
--          (Unit_Name => Kilogram, Unit_Symbol => "kg",  Dim_Symbol => 'M'),
--          (Unit_Name => Second,   Unit_Symbol => 's',   Dim_Symbol => 'T'),
--          (Unit_Name => Ampere,   Unit_Symbol => 'A',   Dim_Symbol => 'I'),
--          (Unit_Name => Kelvin,   Unit_Symbol => 'K',   Dim_Symbol => "Î˜"),
--          (Unit_Name => Mole,     Unit_Symbol => "mol", Dim_Symbol => 'N'),
--          (Unit_Name => Candela,  Unit_Symbol => "cd",  Dim_Symbol => 'J'));

--  * Dimensioned subtype

--    A dimensioned subtype is a subtype directly defined from the dimensioned
--    type and to which the aspect Dimension applies to.

--      subtype Length is Mks_Type
--        with
--         Dimension => (Symbol => 'm',
--           Meter =>  1,
--           others => 0);

--  This package provides a run-time interface for checking the set of
--  restrictions that applies to the current partition. The information
--  comes both from explicit restriction pragmas present, and also from
--  compile time checking.

--  The package simply contains an instantiation of System.Rident, but
--  with names discarded, so that we do not have image tables for the
--  large restriction enumeration types at run time.

   --  Restrictions as set by the user, or detected by the binder. See details
   --  in package System.Rident for what restrictions are included in the list
   --  and the format of the information.
   --
   --  Note that a restriction which is both Set and Violated at run-time means
   --  that the violation was detected as part of the Ada run-time and not as
   --  part of user code.

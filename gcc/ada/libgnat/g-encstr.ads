--  This generic package provides utility routines for converting from
--  Wide_String or Wide_Wide_String to encoded String using a specified
--  encoding convention, which is supplied as the generic parameter. If
--  this parameter is a known at compile time constant (e.g. a constant
--  defined in System.WCh_Con), the instantiation is specialized so that
--  it applies only to this specified coding.

--  Note: this package is only about encoding sequences of 16- or 32-bit
--  characters into a sequence of 8-bit codes. It knows nothing at all about
--  the character encodings being used for the input Wide_Character and
--  Wide_Wide_Character values, although some of the encoding methods (notably
--  JIS and EUC) have built in assumptions about the range of possible input
--  code values. Most often the input will be Unicode/ISO-10646 as specified by
--  the Ada RM, but this package does not make any assumptions about the
--  character coding, and in the case of UTF-8 all possible code values can be
--  encoded. See also the packages Ada.Wide_[Wide_]Characters.Unicode for
--  unicode specific functions.

--  Note on brackets encoding (WCEM_Brackets). On input, upper half characters
--  can be represented as ["hh"] but the routines in this package will only use
--  brackets encodings for codes higher than 16#FF#, so upper half characters
--  will be output as single Character values.

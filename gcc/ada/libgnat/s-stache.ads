   --  to eliminate it, since the old body may still be present in the
   --  compilation environment for a build.

   --  used for the stack base and limit, and is returned by Checked_Self.
   --  Only self may write this information, it may be read by any task.

   --  upgrowing stack) may contain any address that is part of another stack.

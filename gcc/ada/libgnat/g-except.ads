--  This package provides an interface for raising predefined exceptions
--  with an exception message. It can be used from Pure units.

--  There is no prohibition in Ada that prevents exceptions being raised
--  from within pure units. The raise statement is perfectly acceptable.

--  However, it is not normally possible to raise an exception with a
--  message because the routine Ada.Exceptions.Raise_Exception is not in
--  a Pure unit. This is an annoying and unnecessary restriction and this
--  package allows for raising the standard predefined exceptions at least.

package GNAT.Exceptions is
   pragma Pure;

   type Exception_Type is limited null record;
   --  Type used to specify which exception to raise

   --  Really Exception_Type is Exception_Id, but Exception_Id can't be
   --  used directly since it is declared in the non-pure unit Ada.Exceptions,

   --  Exception_Id is in fact simply a pointer to the type Exception_Data
   --  declared in System.Standard_Library (which is also non-pure). So what
   --  we do is to define it here as a by reference type (any by reference
   --  type would do), and then Import the definitions from Standard_Library.
   --  Since this is a by reference type, these will be passed by reference,
   --  which has the same effect as passing a pointer.

   --  This type is not private because keeping it by reference would require
   --  defining it in a way (e.g. using a tagged type) that would drag in other
   --  run-time files, which is unwanted in the case of e.g. Ravenscar where we
   --  want to minimize the number of run-time files needed by default.

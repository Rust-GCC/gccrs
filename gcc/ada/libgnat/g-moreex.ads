--  This package provides routines for accessing the most recently raised
--  exception. This may be useful for certain logging activities. It may
--  also be useful for mimicking implementation dependent capabilities in
--  Ada 83 compilers, but see also GNAT.Current_Exceptions for this usage.

with Ada.Exceptions;
package GNAT.Most_Recent_Exception is

   -----------------
   -- Subprograms --
   -----------------

   function Occurrence
     return Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Occurrence;
   --  Returns the Exception_Occurrence for the most recently raised exception
   --  in the current task. If no exception has been raised in the current task
   --  prior to the call, returns Null_Occurrence.

   function Occurrence_Access
     return Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Occurrence_Access;
   --  Similar to the above, but returns an access to the occurrence value.
   --  This value is in a task specific location, and may be validly accessed
   --  as long as no further exception is raised in the calling task.

   --  Note: unlike the routines in GNAT.Current_Exception, these functions
   --  access the most recently raised exception, regardless of where they
   --  are called. Consider the following example:

   --     exception
   --        when Constraint_Error =>
   --          begin
   --             ...
   --          exception
   --             when Tasking_Error => ...
   --          end;
   --
   --          --  Assuming a Tasking_Error was raised in the inner block,
   --          --  a call to GNAT.Most_Recent_Exception.Occurrence will
   --          --  return information about this Tasking_Error exception,
   --          --  not about the Constraint_Error exception being handled
   --          --  by the current handler code.

end GNAT.Most_Recent_Exception;

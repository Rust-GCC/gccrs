--  This package contains generic procedures for vector operations on arrays.
--  If the arguments are aligned on word boundaries and the word size is a
--  multiple M of the element size, the operations will be done M elements
--  at a time using vector operations on a word.

--  All routines assume argument arrays have the same length, and arguments
--  with mode "in" do not alias arguments with mode "out" or "in out".
--  If the number N of elements to be processed is not a multiple of M
--  the final N rem M elements will be processed one item at a time.

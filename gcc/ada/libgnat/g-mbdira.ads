--  The implementation used in this package was contributed by Robert

--  Journal of Computing, Vol 15. No 2, May 1986. The particular choices for P
--  and Q chosen here guarantee a period of 562,085,314,430,582 (about 2**49),
--  and the generated sequence has excellent randomness properties. For further
--  details, see the paper "Fast Generation of Trustworthy Random Numbers", by
--  Robert Eachus, which describes both the algorithm and the efficient
--  implementation approach used here.

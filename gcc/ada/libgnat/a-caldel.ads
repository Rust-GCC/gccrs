--  This package implements Calendar.Time delays using protected objects

--  Note: the compiler generates direct calls to this interface, in the
--  processing of time types.

package Ada.Calendar.Delays is

   procedure Delay_For (D : Duration);
   --  Delay until an interval of length (at least) D seconds has passed, or
   --  the task is aborted to at least the current ATC nesting level. This is
   --  an abort completion point. The body of this procedure must perform all
   --  the processing required for an abort point.

   procedure Delay_Until (T : Time);
   --  Delay until Clock has reached (at least) time T, or the task is aborted
   --  to at least the current ATC nesting level. The body of this procedure
   --  must perform all the processing required for an abort point.

   function To_Duration (T : Time) return Duration;
   --  Convert Time to Duration elapsed since UNIX epoch

end Ada.Calendar.Delays;

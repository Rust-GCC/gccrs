--  Run-time symbolic traceback support

--  The full capability is currently supported on the following targets:

--     GNU/Linux x86, x86_64
--     Windows x86, x86_64

--  Note: on targets other than those listed above, a dummy implementation
--  of the body returns a series of LF separated strings of the form "0x..."
--  corresponding to the addresses.

--  The routines provided in this package assume that your application has been
--  compiled with debugging information turned on, since this information is
--  used to build a symbolic traceback.

--  If you want to retrieve tracebacks from exception occurrences, it is also
--  necessary to invoke the binder with -E switch. Please refer to the gnatbind
--  documentation for more information.

--  Note that it is also possible (and often recommended) to compute symbolic
--  traceback outside the program execution, which in addition allows you to
--  distribute the executable with no debug info:
--
--     - build your executable with debug info
--     - archive this executable
--     - strip a copy of the executable and distribute/deploy this version
--     - at run time, compute absolute traceback (-bargs -E) from your
--       executable and log it using Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Information
--     - off line, compute the symbolic traceback using the executable archived
--       with debug info and addr2line or gdb (using info line *<addr>) on the
--       absolute addresses logged by your application.

--  In order to retrieve symbolic information, functions in this package will
--  read on disk all the debug information of the executable file (found via
--  Argument (0), and looked in the PATH if needed) or shared libraries using
--  OS facilities, and load them in memory, causing a significant cpu and
--  memory overhead.

--  Symbolic traceback from shared libraries is only supported for Windows and
--  Linux. On other targets symbolic tracebacks are only supported for the main
--  executable. You should consider using gdb to obtain symbolic traceback in
--  such cases.

   --  In the above, _No_Hex means do not print any hexadecimal addresses, even

   --  output from tests.

   procedure Enable_Cache (Include_Modules : Boolean := False);
   --  Read symbolic information from binary files and cache them in memory.
   --  This will speed up the above functions but will require more memory. If
   --  Include_Modules is true, shared modules (or DLL) will also be cached.
   --  This procedure may do nothing if not supported. The profile of this
   --  subprogram may change in the future (new parameters can be added
   --  with default value), but backward compatibility for direct calls
   --  is supported.

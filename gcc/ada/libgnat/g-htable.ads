--  Hash table searching routines

--  This package contains two separate packages. The Simple_HTable package
--  provides a very simple abstraction that associates one element to one
--  key value and takes care of all allocations automatically using the heap.
--  The Static_HTable package provides a more complex interface that allows
--  complete control over allocation.

--  See file s-htable.ads for full documentation of the interface

with System.HTable;

package GNAT.HTable is
   pragma Preelaborate;
   pragma Elaborate_Body;
   --  The elaborate body is because we have a dummy body to deal with
   --  bootstrap path problems (we used to have a real body, and now we don't
   --  need it any more, but the bootstrap requires that we have a dummy body,
   --  since otherwise the old body gets picked up; also, we can't use pragma
   --  No_Body because older bootstrap compilers don't support that).

   generic package Static_HTable renames System.HTable.Static_HTable;

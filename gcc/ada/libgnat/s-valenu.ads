--  This package is used to compute the Value attribute for enumeration types
--  other than those in packages Standard and System. See unit Exp_Imgv for
--  details of the format of constructed image tables.

   pragma Preelaborate;

   function Value_Enumeration_8
     (Names   : String;
      Indexes : System.Address;
      Num     : Natural;
      Str     : String)
      return    Natural;
   --  Used to compute Enum'Value (Str) where Enum is some enumeration type
   --  other than those defined in package Standard. Names is a string with
   --  a lower bound of 1 containing the characters of all the enumeration
   --  literals concatenated together in sequence. Indexes is the address
   --  of an array of type array (0 .. N) of Natural_8, where N is the
   --  number of enumeration literals in the type. The Indexes values are
   --  the starting subscript of each enumeration literal, indexed by Pos
   --  values, with an extra entry at the end containing Names'Length + 1.
   --  The parameter Num is the value N - 1 (i.e. Enum'Pos (Enum'Last)).
   --  The reason that Indexes is passed by address is that the actual type
   --  is created on the fly by the expander.
   --
   --  Str is the argument of the attribute function, and may have leading
   --  and trailing spaces, and letters can be upper or lower case or mixed.
   --  If the image is found in Names, then the corresponding Pos value is
   --  returned. If not, Constraint_Error is raised.

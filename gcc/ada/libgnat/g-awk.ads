-- Extensive contributions were provided by Ada Core Technologies Inc.      --
--                                                                          --
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--  This is an AWK-like unit. It provides an easy interface for parsing one
--  or more files containing formatted data. The file can be viewed seen as
--  a database where each record is a line and a field is a data element in
--  this line. In this implementation an AWK record is a line. This means
--  that a record cannot span multiple lines. The operating procedure is to
--  read files line by line, with each line being presented to the user of
--  the package. The interface provides services to access specific fields
--  in the line. Thus it is possible to control actions taken on a line based
--  on values of some fields. This can be achieved directly or by registering
--  callbacks triggered on programmed conditions.
--
--  The state of an AWK run is recorded in an object of type session.
--  The following is the procedure for using a session to control an
--  AWK run:
--
--     1) Specify which session is to be used. It is possible to use the
--        default session or to create a new one by declaring an object of
--        type Session_Type. For example:
--
--           Computers : Session_Type;
--
--     2) Specify how to cut a line into fields. There are two modes: using
--        character fields separators or column width. This is done by using
--        Set_Fields_Separators or Set_Fields_Width. For example by:
--
--           AWK.Set_Field_Separators (";,", Computers);
--
--        or by using iterators' Separators parameter.
--
--     3) Specify which files to parse. This is done with Add_File/Add_Files
--        services, or by using the iterators' Filename parameter. For
--        example:
--
--           AWK.Add_File ("myfile.db", Computers);
--
--     4) Run the AWK session using one of the provided iterators.
--
--           Parse
--              This is the most automated iterator. You can gain control on
--              the session only by registering one or more callbacks (see
--              Register).
--
--           Get_Line/End_Of_Data
--              This is a manual iterator to be used with a loop. You have
--              complete control on the session. You can use callbacks but
--              this is not required.
--
--           For_Every_Line
--              This provides a mixture of manual/automated iterator action.
--
--        Examples of these three approaches appear below
--
--  There are many ways to use this package. The following discussion shows
--  three approaches to using this package, using the three iterator forms.
--  All examples will use the following file (computer.db):
--
--     Pluton;Windows-NT;Pentium III
--     Mars;Linux;Pentium Pro
--     Venus;Solaris;Sparc
--     Saturn;OS/2;i486
--     Jupiter;MacOS;PPC
--
--  1) Using Parse iterator
--
--     Here the first step is to register some action associated to a pattern
--     and then to call the Parse iterator (this is the simplest way to use
--     this unit). The default session is used here. For example to output the
--     second field (the OS) of computer "Saturn".
--
--           procedure Action is
--           begin
--              Put_Line (AWK.Field (2));
--           end Action;
--
--        begin
--           AWK.Register (1, "Saturn", Action'Access);
--           AWK.Parse (";", "computer.db");
--
--
--  2) Using the Get_Line/End_Of_Data iterator
--
--     Here you have full control. For example to do the same as
--     above but using a specific session, you could write:
--
--           Computer_File : Session_Type;
--
--        begin
--           AWK.Set_Current (Computer_File);
--           AWK.Open (Separators => ";",
--                     Filename   => "computer.db");
--
--           --  Display Saturn OS
--
--           while not AWK.End_Of_File loop
--              AWK.Get_Line;
--
--              if AWK.Field (1) = "Saturn" then
--                 Put_Line (AWK.Field (2));
--              end if;
--           end loop;
--
--           AWK.Close (Computer_File);
--
--
--  3) Using For_Every_Line iterator
--
--     In this case you use a provided iterator and you pass the procedure
--     that must be called for each record. You could code the previous
--     example could be coded as follows (using the iterator quick interface
--     but without using the current session):
--
--           Computer_File : Session_Type;
--
--           procedure Action (Quit : in out Boolean) is
--           begin
--              if AWK.Field (1, Computer_File) = "Saturn" then
--                 Put_Line (AWK.Field (2, Computer_File));
--              end if;
--           end Action;
--
--           procedure Look_For_Saturn is
--              new AWK.For_Every_Line (Action);
--
--        begin
--           Look_For_Saturn (Separators => ";",
--                            Filename   => "computer.db",
--                            Session    => Computer_File);
--
--           Integer_Text_IO.Put
--             (Integer (AWK.NR (Session => Computer_File)));
--           Put_Line (" line(s) have been processed.");
--
--  You can also use a regular expression for the pattern. Let us output
--  the computer name for all computer for which the OS has a character
--  O in its name.
--
--           Regexp   : String := ".*O.*";
--
--           Matcher  : Regpat.Pattern_Matcher := Regpat.Compile (Regexp);
--
--           procedure Action is
--           begin
--              Text_IO.Put_Line (AWK.Field (2));
--           end Action;
--
--        begin
--           AWK.Register (2, Matcher, Action'Unrestricted_Access);
--           AWK.Parse (";", "computer.db");

   --------------------
   -- Pattern/Action --
   --------------------

   --  AWK defines rules like "PATTERN { ACTION }". Which means that ACTION
   --  will be executed if PATTERN match. A pattern in this implementation can
   --  be a simple string (match function is equality), a regular expression,
   --  a function returning a boolean. An action is associated to a pattern
   --  using the Register services.
   --
   --  Each procedure Register will add a rule to the set of rules for the
   --  session. Rules are examined in the order they have been added.

   type Pattern_Callback is access function return Boolean;
   --  This is a pattern function pointer. When it returns True the associated
   --  action will be called.

   type Action_Callback is access procedure;
   --  A simple action pointer

   type Match_Action_Callback is
     access procedure (Matches : GNAT.Regpat.Match_Array);
   --  An advanced action pointer used with a regular expression pattern. It
   --  returns an array of all the matches. See GNAT.Regpat for further
   --  information.

   --  Register an Action associated with a Pattern. The pattern here is a
   --  function that must return a boolean. Action callback will be called if
   --  the pattern callback returns True and nothing will happen if it is
   --  False. This version is more general, the two other register services
   --  trigger an action based on the value of a single field only.

   procedure Register
     (Action  : Action_Callback;
      Session : Session_Type);
   procedure Register
     (Action  : Action_Callback);
   --  Register an Action that will be called for every line. This is
   --  equivalent to a Pattern_Callback function always returning True.

   --  Launch the iterator, it will read every line in all specified

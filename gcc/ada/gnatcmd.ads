--  This program provides a simple command interface for using GNAT and its
--  associated utilities.

--    The program is typically called GNAT when it is installed and
--    the two possible styles of use are:

--  To call gcc:

--    GNAT compile filename switches

--  To call the tool gnatxxx

--    GNAT xxx filename switches

--  where xxx is the command name (e.g. MAKE for gnatmake).

--  This package contains the low level, operating system routines used only
--  in gnatls for command line processing and file input output.

package Osint.L is

   function More_Lib_Files return Boolean;
   --  Indicates whether more library information files remain to be processed.
   --  Returns False right away if no source files, or if all source files
   --  have been processed.

   function Next_Main_Lib_File return File_Name_Type;
   --  This function returns the name of the next library info file specified
   --  on the command line. It is an error to call Next_Main_Lib_File if no
   --  more library information files exist (i.e. Next_Main_Lib_File may be
   --  called only if a previous call to More_Lib_Files returned True). This
   --  name is the simple name, excluding any directory information.

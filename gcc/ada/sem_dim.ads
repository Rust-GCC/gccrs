--  This package provides support for numerical systems with dimensions. A
--  "dimension" is a compile-time property of a numerical type which represents
--  a relation between various quantifiers such as length, velocity, etc.

--  Package System.Dim.Mks offers a ready-to-use system of SI base units. In
--  addition, the implementation of this feature offers the ability to define
--  an arbitrary system of units through the use of Ada 2012 aspects.

--  Dimensionality checking is part of type analysis performed by the compiler.
--  It ensures that manipulation of quantified numeric values is sensible with
--  respect to the system of units.

-----------------------------
-- Aspect_Dimension_System --
-----------------------------

--  In order to enable the user to create their own dimension system, a new
--  aspect: Aspect_Dimension_System has been created.

--  Note that this aspect applies for type declaration of type derived from any
--  numeric type.

--  It defines the names of each dimension

----------------------
-- Aspect_Dimension --
----------------------

--  This new aspect applies for subtype and object declarations in order to
--  define new dimensions.

--  Using this aspect, the user is able to create new subtype/object with any
--  dimension needed.

--  Note that the base type of the subtype/object must be the type that defines
--  the corresponding dimension system.

--  The expression of this aspect is an aggregate of rational values for each
--  dimension in the corresponding dimension system.

-------------------------------------------
-- Dimensionality checking & propagation --
-------------------------------------------

--  For each node (when needed), a dimension analysis (Analyze_Dimension) is
--  performed as part of the Resolution routine or the Analysis routine if no
--  Resolution.

--  The dimension analysis is divided into two phases:

--  Phase 1: dimension checking

--  Phase 2: propagation of dimensions

--  Depending on the node kind, either none, one phase or two phases are
--  executed.

--  Phase 2 is called only when the node allows a dimension (see body of
--  Sem_Dim to get the list of nodes that permit dimensions).

--  In principle every node that is a component of a floating-point expression
--  may have a dimension vector. However, the dimensionality checking is for
--  the most part a bottom-up tree traversal, and the dimensions of operands
--  become irrelevant once the dimensions of an operation have been computed.
--  To minimize space use, the dimensions of operands are removed after the
--  computation of the dimensions of the parent operation. This may complicate
--  the analysis of nodes that have been constant-folded or otherwise rewritten
--  when removing side effects. In such cases, the (sub)type of the expression
--  is used to determine the applicable dimensions.

   --    * Elementary function case: check each actual is dimensionless except

   --  Step 2. Dimension propagation (only for functions):
   --    * General case: propagate the dimensions from the returned type to the
   --      function call.

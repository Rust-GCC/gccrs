   -- Host/Target Dependencies --
   ------------------------------

   --  It is vital to maintain a clear distinction between properties of
   --  types on the host and types on the target, since in the general
   --  case of a cross-compiler these will be different.

   --  This package provides definitions of values that describe the properties
   --  of the target types. All instances of target dependencies, including the
   --  definitions of such packages as Standard and System depend directly or
   --  indirectly on the definitions in the Ttypes packages.

   --  In the source of the compiler, references to attributes such as
   --  Integer'Size will give information regarding the host types (i.e.
   --  the types within the compiler itself). Such references are therefore
   --  almost always suspicious (it is hard for example to see that the
   --  code in the compiler should even be using type Integer very much,
   --  and certainly this code should not depend on the size of Integer).

   --  On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable for the compiler to
   --  require access to the size of type Integer for the target machine,
   --  e.g. in constructing the internal representation of package Standard.
   --  For this purpose, instead of referencing the attribute Integer'Size,
   --  a reference to Ttypes.Standard_Integer_Size will provide the needed
   --  value for the target type.

   --  Two approaches are used for handling target dependent values in the
   --  standard library packages. Package Standard is handled specially,
   --  being constructed internally (by package Stand). Target dependent
   --  values needed in Stand are obtained by direct reference to Ttypes
   --  and Ttypef.

   --  For package System, there is a separate version for each target, with
   --  explicit declarations of the required, constants.

   --  Historical note: Originally we had in mind dealing with target dependent
   --  differences by referencing appropriate attributes. Ada 95 already
   --  defines most of the required attributes, and GNAT specific attributes
   --  were defined to cover the remaining cases (such as Storage_Unit).
   --  The additional attributes that have been added to GNAT (Address_Size,
   --  Storage_Unit, and Word_Size) are redundant with respect to the
   --  corresponding references to System constants. For example in a program,
   --  System.Address_Size and Standard'Address_Size yield the same value.
   --  These attributes have been retained for compatibility purposes, but
   --  serve no purpose at this stage.

   --  Note that during compilation there are two versions of package System
   --  around. The version that is directly with'ed by compiler packages
   --  contains host-dependent definitions, which is what is needed in that
   --  case (for example, System.Storage_Unit referenced in the source of the
   --  compiler refers to the storage unit of the host, not the target). This
   --  means that, like attribute references, any references to constants in
   --  package System in the compiler code are suspicious, since it is strange
   --  for the compiler to have such host dependencies. If the compiler needs
   --  to access the target dependent values of such quantities as Storage_Unit
   --  then it should reference the constants in this package (Ttypes), rather
   --  than referencing System.Storage_Unit, or Standard'Storage_Unit, both of
   --  which would yield the host value.

   --  Note: GNAT always supplies all the following integer and float types,

   --  type has fewer than 2**(Character'Size) elements, then the size

   --  type capable of representing the required range of values.

   --  True if we are in short enums mode, where foreign convention
   --  (in particular C and C++) enumeration types will be sized as in Ada,

   --  A zero value means Short_Enums are not in use, and in this case all

   Target_Strict_Alignment : Boolean :=
                               Set_Targ.Strict_Alignment /= 0;

   --  point types whose size is equal to 64 bits, or 0 if this alignment is

   -- Source File Table --
   -----------------------

   --  A table entry is built for every source file that is in the source
   --  dependency table of any ALI file that is part of the current program.

   No_Source_Id : constant Source_Id := Source_Id'First;
   --  Special value indicating no Source table entry

   First_Source_Entry : constant Source_Id := No_Source_Id + 1;
   --  Id of first actual entry in table

   type Source_Record is record

      Sfile : File_Name_Type;
      --  Name of source file

      Stamp : Time_Stamp_Type;
      --  Time stamp value. If Check_Source_Files is set and the source
      --  file is located, then Stamp is set from the source file. Otherwise
      --  Stamp is set from the latest stamp value found in any of the
      --  ALI files for the current program.

      Source_Found : Boolean;
      --  This flag is set to True if the corresponding source file was
      --  located and the Stamp value was set from the actual source file.
      --  It is always false if Check_Source_Files is not set.

      Stamp_File : File_Name_Type;
      --  File that Stamp came from. If Source_Found is True, then Stamp is the
      --  timestamp of the source file, and this is the name of the source
      --  file. If Source_Found is False, then Stamp comes from a dependency
      --  line in an ALI file, this is the name of that ALI file. Used only in
      --  verbose mode, for messages.

      All_Timestamps_Match : Boolean;
      --  This flag is set only if all files referencing this source file
      --  have a matching time stamp, and also, if Source_Found is True,
      --  then the stamp of the source file also matches. If this flag is
      --  True, then checksums for this file are never referenced. We only
      --  use checksums if there are time stamp mismatches.

      All_Checksums_Match : Boolean;
      --  This flag is set only if all files referencing this source file
      --  have checksums, and if all these checksums match. If this flag
      --  is set to True, then the binder will ignore a timestamp mismatch.
      --  An absent checksum causes this flag to be set False, and a mismatch
      --  of checksums also causes it to be set False. The checksum of the
      --  actual source file (if Source_Found is True) is included only if
      --  All_Timestamps_Match is False (since checksums are only interesting
      --  if we have time stamp mismatches, and we want to avoid computing the
      --  checksum of the source file if it is not needed.)

      Checksum : Word;
      --  If no dependency line has a checksum for this source file (i.e. the
      --  corresponding entries in the source dependency records all have the
      --  Checksum_Present flag set False), then this field is undefined. If
      --  at least one dependency entry has a checksum present, then this
      --  field contains one of the possible checksum values that has been
      --  seen. This is used to set All_Checksums_Match properly.

   --  Compute checksum for the given file. As far as possible, this circuit
   --  computes exactly the same value computed by the compiler, but it does
   --  not matter if it gets it wrong in marginal cases, since the only result
   --  is to miss some smart recompilation cases, correct functioning is not
   --  affected by a miscomputation. Returns Checksum_Error if the file is
   --  missing or has an error.

   --  Returns True if Checksum1 and Checksum2 have the same value and are
   --  not equal to Checksum_Error, returns False in all other cases. This

   --  ensure that the case of Checksum_Error is handled properly.

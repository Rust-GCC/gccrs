   --  Determine elaboration order.
   --
   --  The Elab_Order table records the chosen elaboration order. It is used by
   --  Gen_Elab_Calls to generate the sequence of elaboration calls. Note that
   --  units are included in this table even if they have no elaboration
   --  routine, since the table is also used to drive the generation of object
   --  files in the binder output. Gen_Elab_Calls skips any units that have no
   --  elaboration routine.

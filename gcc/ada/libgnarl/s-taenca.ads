--  This package provides internal RTS calls implementing operations
--  that apply to general entry calls, that is, calls to either
--  protected or task entries.

--  These declarations are not part of the GNARL Interface

package System.Tasking.Entry_Calls is

   procedure Wait_For_Completion (Entry_Call : Entry_Call_Link);
   --  This procedure suspends the calling task until the specified entry
   --  call has either been completed or cancelled. It performs other
   --  operations required of suspended tasks, such as performing
   --  dynamic priority changes. On exit, the call will not be queued.
   --  This waits for calls on task or protected entries.
   --  Abortion must be deferred when calling this procedure.
   --  Call this only when holding Self (= Entry_Call.Self) or global RTS lock.

   procedure Wait_For_Completion_With_Timeout
     (Entry_Call  : Entry_Call_Link;
      Wakeup_Time : Duration;
      Mode        : Delay_Modes;
      Yielded     : out Boolean);
   --  Same as Wait_For_Completion but wait for a timeout with the value
   --  specified in Wakeup_Time as well.
   --  On return, Yielded indicates whether the wait has performed a yield.
   --  Check_Exception must be called after calling this procedure.

   procedure Wait_Until_Abortable
     (Self_ID : Task_Id;
      Call    : Entry_Call_Link);
   --  This procedure suspends the calling task until the specified entry
   --  call is queued abortably or completes.
   --  Abortion must be deferred when calling this procedure.

   procedure Try_To_Cancel_Entry_Call (Succeeded : out Boolean);
   pragma Inline (Try_To_Cancel_Entry_Call);
   --  Try to cancel async. entry call.
   --  Effect includes Abort_To_Level and Wait_For_Completion.
   --  Cancelled = True iff the cancellation was successful, i.e.,
   --  the call was not Done before this call.
   --  On return, the call is off-queue and the ATC level is reduced by one.

   procedure Reset_Priority
     (Acceptor               : Task_Id;
      Acceptor_Prev_Priority : Rendezvous_Priority);
   pragma Inline (Reset_Priority);
   --  Reset the priority of a task completing an accept statement to
   --  the value it had before the call.
   --  Acceptor should always be equal to Self.

   procedure Check_Exception
     (Self_ID    : Task_Id;
      Entry_Call : Entry_Call_Link);
   pragma Inline (Check_Exception);
   --  Raise any pending exception from the Entry_Call.
   --  This should be called at the end of every compiler interface procedure
   --  that implements an entry call.
   --  In principle, the caller should not be abort-deferred (unless the
   --  application program violates the Ada language rules by doing entry calls
   --  from within protected operations -- an erroneous practice apparently
   --  followed with success by some adventurous GNAT users).
   --  Absolutely, the caller should not be holding any locks, or there
   --  will be deadlock.

--  This is the SuSV3 threads version of this package

--  Make a careful study of all signals available under the OS, to see which
--  need to be reserved, kept always unmasked, or kept always unmasked. Be on
--  the lookout for special signals that may be used by the thread library.

--  Since this is a multi target file, the signal <-> exception mapping
--  is simple minded. If you need a more precise and target specific
--  signal handling, create a new s-intman.adb that will fit your needs.

--  This file assumes that:

--    SIGINT exists and will be kept unmasked unless the pragma
--     Unreserve_All_Interrupts is specified anywhere in the application.

--    System.OS_Interface contains the following:
--      SIGADAABORT: the signal that will be used to abort tasks.
--      Unmasked: the OS specific set of signals that should be unmasked in
--                all the threads. SIGADAABORT is unmasked by
--                default
--      Reserved: the OS specific set of signals that are reserved.

   --  interrupt number, and the result is one of the following:

   User    : constant Character := 'u';

   Default : constant Character := 's';
   --    'n'   this interrupt not set by any Interrupt_State pragma
   --    'u'   Interrupt_State pragma set state to User
   --    'r'   Interrupt_State pragma set state to Runtime
   --    's'   Interrupt_State pragma set state to System (use "default"

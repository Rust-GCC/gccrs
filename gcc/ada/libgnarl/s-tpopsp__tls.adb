   --  To make Ada tasks and C threads interoperate better, we have added some
   --  functionality to Self. Suppose a C main program (with threads) calls an
   --  Ada procedure and the Ada procedure calls the tasking runtime system.
   --  Eventually, a call will be made to self. Since the call is not coming
   --  from an Ada task, there will be no corresponding ATCB.

   --  What we do in Self is to catch references that do not come from
   --  recognized Ada tasks, and create an ATCB for the calling thread.

   --  The new ATCB will be "detached" from the normal Ada task master
   --  hierarchy, much like the existing implicitly created signal-server
   --  tasks.

--  This package provides exported subprograms to be called at debug time to
--  measure stack usage at run-time.

--  Note: this package must be a child package of System.Stack_Usage to have
--  visibility over its private part; it is however part of GNARL because it
--  needs to access tasking features via System.Tasking.Debug and
--  System.Task_Primitives.Operations;

package System.Stack_Usage.Tasking is

   procedure Report_All_Tasks;
   --  Print the current stack usage of all tasks on stderr. Exported to be
   --  called also in debug mode.

   pragma Export
     (C,
      Report_All_Tasks,
      "__gnat_tasks_stack_usage_report_all_tasks");

   procedure Report_Current_Task;
   --  Print the stack usage of current task on stderr. Exported to be called
   --  also in debug mode.

   pragma Export
     (C,
      Report_Current_Task,
      "__gnat_tasks_stack_usage_report_current_task");

   subtype Stack_Usage_Result is System.Stack_Usage.Task_Result;
   --  This type is a descriptor for task stack usage result

   type Stack_Usage_Result_Array is
     array (Positive range <>) of Stack_Usage_Result;

   function Get_Current_Task_Usage return Stack_Usage_Result;
   --  Return the current stack usage for the invoking task

   function Get_All_Tasks_Usage return Stack_Usage_Result_Array;
   --  Return an array containing the stack usage results for all tasks

   procedure Print (Obj : Stack_Usage_Result);
   --  Print Obj on stderr

end System.Stack_Usage.Tasking;

   ----------------------
   -- Protection Types --
   ----------------------

   --  Routines and types needed to implement Interrupt_Handler and
   --  Attach_Handler.

   --  There are two kinds of protected objects that deal with interrupts:

   --  (1) Only Interrupt_Handler pragmas are used. We need to be able to tell
   --  if an Interrupt_Handler applies to a given procedure, so
   --  Register_Interrupt_Handler has to be called for all the potential
   --  handlers, it should be done by calling Register_Interrupt_Handler with
   --  the handler code address. On finalization, which can happen only has
   --  part of library level finalization since PO with Interrupt_Handler
   --  pragmas can only be declared at library level, nothing special needs to
   --  be done since the default handlers have been restored as part of task
   --  completion which is done just before global finalization.
   --  Dynamic_Interrupt_Protection should be used in this case.

   --  (2) Attach_Handler pragmas are used, and possibly Interrupt_Handler
   --  pragma. We need to attach the handlers to the given interrupts when the
   --  object is elaborated. This should be done by constructing an array of
   --  pairs (interrupt, handler) from the pragmas and calling Install_Handlers
   --  with it (types to be used are New_Handler_Item and New_Handler_Array).
   --  On finalization, we need to restore the handlers that were installed
   --  before the elaboration of the PO, so we need to store these previous
   --  handlers. This is also done by Install_Handlers, the room for this
   --  information is provided by adding a discriminant which is the number
   --  of Attach_Handler pragmas and an array of this size in the protection
   --  type, Static_Interrupt_Protection.

   procedure Register_Interrupt_Handler
     (Handler_Addr : System.Address);
   --  This routine should be called by the compiler to allow the handler be
   --  used as an Interrupt Handler. That means call this procedure for each
   --  pragma Interrupt_Handler providing the address of the handler (not
   --  including the pointer to the actual PO, this way this routine is called
   --  only once for each type definition of PO).

   type Static_Handler_Index is range 0 .. Integer'Last;
   subtype Positive_Static_Handler_Index is
     Static_Handler_Index range 1 .. Static_Handler_Index'Last;
   --  Comment needed ???

   type Previous_Handler_Item is record
      Interrupt : Interrupt_ID;
      Handler   : Parameterless_Handler;
      Static    : Boolean;
   end record;
   --  Contains all the information needed to restore a previous handler

   type Previous_Handler_Array is array
     (Positive_Static_Handler_Index range <>) of Previous_Handler_Item;

   type New_Handler_Item is record
      Interrupt : Interrupt_ID;
      Handler   : Parameterless_Handler;
   end record;
   --  Contains all the information from an Attach_Handler pragma

   type New_Handler_Array is
     array (Positive_Static_Handler_Index range <>) of New_Handler_Item;
   --  Comment needed ???

   --  Case (1)

   type Dynamic_Interrupt_Protection is new
     Tasking.Protected_Objects.Entries.Protection_Entries with null record;

   --  ??? Finalize is not overloaded since we currently have no
   --  way to detach the handlers during library level finalization.

   function Has_Interrupt_Or_Attach_Handler
     (Object : access Dynamic_Interrupt_Protection) return Boolean;
   --  Returns True

   --  Case (2)

   type Static_Interrupt_Protection
     (Num_Entries        : Tasking.Protected_Objects.Protected_Entry_Index;
      Num_Attach_Handler : Static_Handler_Index)
   is new
     Tasking.Protected_Objects.Entries.Protection_Entries (Num_Entries) with
     record
       Previous_Handlers : Previous_Handler_Array (1 .. Num_Attach_Handler);
     end record;

   function Has_Interrupt_Or_Attach_Handler
     (Object : access Static_Interrupt_Protection) return Boolean;
   --  Returns True

   overriding procedure Finalize (Object : in out Static_Interrupt_Protection);
   --  Restore previous handlers as required by C.3.1(12) then call
   --  Finalize (Protection).

   procedure Install_Handlers
     (Object       : access Static_Interrupt_Protection;
      New_Handlers : New_Handler_Array);
   --  Store the old handlers in Object.Previous_Handlers and install
   --  the new static handlers.

   procedure Install_Restricted_Handlers
     (Prio     : Interrupt_Priority;
      Handlers : New_Handler_Array);
   --  Install the static Handlers for the given interrupts and do not
   --  store previously installed handlers. This procedure is used when
   --  the Ravenscar restrictions are in place since in that case there
   --  are only library-level protected handlers that will be installed
   --  at initialization and never be replaced.

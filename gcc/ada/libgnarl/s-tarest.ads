--  This is a simplified version of the System.Tasking.Stages package,
--  intended to be used in a restricted run time.

--  This package represents the high level tasking interface used by the
--  compiler to expand Ada 95 tasking constructs into simpler run time calls
--  (aka GNARLI, GNU Ada Run-time Library Interface)

--  Note: the compiler generates direct calls to this interface, via Rtsfind.
--  Any changes to this interface may require corresponding compiler changes
--  in exp_ch9.adb and possibly exp_ch7.adb

--  The restricted GNARLI is also composed of System.Protected_Objects and
--  System.Protected_Objects.Single_Entry

with System.Parameters;
with System.Secondary_Stack;
with System.Task_Info;

   --  elaboration policy is not specified (or is concurrent).
   --
   --  Priority is the task's priority (assumed to be in the
   --  System.Any_Priority'Range).
   --
   --  Stack_Address is the start address of the stack associated to the task,
   --  in case it has been preallocated by the compiler; it is equal to
   --  Null_Address when the stack needs to be allocated by the underlying
   --  operating system.
   --
   --  Stack_Size is the stack size of the task to create.
   --
   --  Sec_Stack_Address is the pointer to the secondary stack created by the
   --  compiler. If null, the secondary stack is either allocated by the binder
   --  or the run-time.
   --
   --  Secondary_Stack_Size is the secondary stack size of the task to create.
   --
   --  Task_Info is the task info associated with the created task, or
   --  Unspecified_Task_Info if none.
   --
   --  CPU is the task affinity. We pass it as an Integer to avoid an explicit
   --   dependency from System.Multiprocessors when not needed. Static range
   --   checks are performed when analyzing the pragma, and dynamic ones are
   --   performed before setting the affinity at run time.
   --
   --  State is the compiler generated task's procedure body.
   --
   --  Discriminants is a pointer to a limited record whose discriminants are
   --  those of the task to create. This parameter should be passed as the
   --  single argument to State.
   --
   --  Elaborated is a pointer to a Boolean that must be set to true on exit
   --  if the task could be successfully elaborated.
   --
   --  Chain is a linked list of task that needs to be created. On exit,
   --  Created_Task.Activation_Link will be Chain.T_ID, and Chain.T_ID will be
   --  Created_Task (the created task will be linked at the front of Chain).
   --
   --  Task_Image is a string created by the compiler that the run time can
   --  store to ease the debugging and the Ada.Task_Identification facility.
   --
   --  Created_Task is the resulting task.
   --
   --  This procedure can raise Storage_Error if the task creation fails.

   --  are already in the All_Tasks_List.
   --
   --  The compiler builds the chain in LIFO order (as a stack). Another
   --  version of this procedure had code to reverse the chain, so as to
   --  activate the tasks in the order of declaration. This might be nice, but
   --  it is not needed if priority-based scheduling is supported, since all
   --  the activated tasks synchronize on the activators lock before they start
   --  activating and so they should start activating in priority order.

   --  declarative part. Decrement the count of tasks to be activated by the
   --  activator and wake it up so it can check to see if all tasks have been
   --  activated. Except for the environment task, which should never call this
   --  procedure, T.Activator should only be null iff T has completed
   --  activation.

   procedure Complete_Restricted_Task;
   --  Compiler interface only. Do not call from within the RTS. This should be
   --  called from an implicit at-end handler associated with the task body,
   --  when it completes. From this point, the current task will become not
   --  callable. If the current task have not completed activation, this should
   --  be done now in order to wake up the activator (the environment task).

   function Restricted_Terminated (T : Task_Id) return Boolean;
   --  Compiler interface only. Do not call from within the RTS. This is called
   --  by the compiler to implement the 'Terminated attribute.
   --

   --     T1'Terminated
   --
   --  code expansion:
   --     restricted_terminated (t1._task_id)

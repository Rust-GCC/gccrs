--  This package provides facilities for creation or registration of foreign
--  threads for use as Ada tasks. In order to execute general Ada code, the
--  run-time system must know about all tasks. This package allows foreign
--  code, e.g. a C program, to create a thread that the Ada run-time knows
--  about, or to register the current thread.

--  For some implementations of GNAT Pro, the registration of foreign threads
--  is automatic. However, in such implementations, if the Ada program has no
--  tasks at all and no tasking constructs other than delay, then by default
--  the non-tasking version of the Ada run-time will be loaded. If foreign
--  threads are present, it is important to ensure that the tasking version
--  of the Ada run time is loaded. This may be achieved by adding "with
--  GNAT.Threads" to any unit in the partition.

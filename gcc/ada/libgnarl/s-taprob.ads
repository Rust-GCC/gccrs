--  This package provides necessary definitions to handle simple (i.e without
--  entries) protected objects.

--  All the routines that handle protected objects with entries have been moved
--  to two children: Entries and Operations. Note that Entries only contains
--  the type declaration and the OO primitives. This is needed to avoid
--  circular dependency.

--  This package is part of the high level tasking interface used by the
--  compiler to expand Ada 95 tasking constructs into simpler run time calls
--  (aka GNARLI, GNU Ada Run-time Library Interface)

--  Note: the compiler generates direct calls to this interface, via Rtsfind.
--  Any changes to this interface may require corresponding compiler changes
--  in exp_ch9.adb and possibly exp_ch7.adb and exp_attr.adb

   type Barrier_Function_Pointer is access
     function
       (O    : System.Address;
        E    : Protected_Entry_Index)
        return Boolean;
   --  Pointer to a function which evaluates the barrier of a protected
   --  entry body. O is a pointer to the compiler-generated record
   --  representing the protected object, and E is the index of the
   --  entry serviced by the body.

     procedure
       (O : System.Address;

   --  record of entry parameters, and E is the index of the

   --  The compiler-generated code passes objects of this type to the GNARL
   --  to allow it to access the executable code of an entry body and its
   --  barrier.

   type Protection is limited private;
   --  This type contains the GNARL state of a protected object. The
   --  application-defined portion of the state (i.e. private objects)
   --  is maintained by the compiler-generated code.
   --  Note that there are now 2 Protection types. One for the simple
   --  case (no entries) and one for the general case that needs the whole
   --  Finalization mechanism.
   --  This split helps in the case of restricted run time where we want to
   --  minimize the size of the code.

   --  to keep track of the runtime state of a protected object.

   procedure Lock (Object : Protection_Access);
   --  Lock a protected object for write access. Upon return, the caller
   --  owns the lock to this object, and no other call to Lock or
   --  Lock_Read_Only with the same argument will return until the
   --  corresponding call to Unlock has been made by the caller.

   procedure Lock_Read_Only (Object : Protection_Access);
   --  Lock a protected object for read access. Upon return, the caller
   --  owns the lock for read access, and no other calls to Lock with the
   --  same argument will return until the corresponding call to Unlock
   --  has been made by the caller. Other calls to Lock_Read_Only may (but
   --  need not) return before the call to Unlock, and the corresponding
   --  callers will also own the lock for read access.

   procedure Set_Ceiling
     (Object : Protection_Access;
      Prio   : System.Any_Priority);
   --  Sets the new ceiling priority of the protected object

   procedure Unlock (Object : Protection_Access);
   --  Relinquish ownership of the lock for the object represented by
   --  the Object parameter. If this ownership was for write access, or
   --  if it was for read access where there are no other read access
   --  locks outstanding, one (or more, in the case of Lock_Read_Only)
   --  of the tasks waiting on this lock (if any) will be given the
   --  lock and allowed to return from the Lock or Lock_Read_Only call.

      --  of assignment of a new ceiling priority to the protected object the

      --  this field. After such assignment this value can be read by means
      --  of the 'Priority attribute, which generates a call to get_ceiling.
      --  However, the ceiling of the protected object will not be changed
      --  until completion of the protected action in which the assignment
      --  has been executed (AARM D.5.2 (10/2)).

      Owner : Task_Id;
      --  This field contains the protected object's owner. Null_Task
      --  indicates that the protected object is not currently being used.
      --  This information is used for detecting the type of potentially
      --  blocking operations described in the ARM 9.5.1, par. 15 (external
      --  calls on a protected subprogram with the same target object as that
      --  of the protected action).

   procedure Activate_Tasks (Chain_Access : Activation_Chain_Access);
   --  Compiler interface only. Do not call from within the RTS.
   --  This must be called by the creator of a chain of one or more new tasks,
   --  to activate them. The chain is a linked list that up to this point is
   --  only known to the task that created them, though the individual tasks
   --  are already in the All_Tasks_List.
   --
   --  The compiler builds the chain in LIFO order (as a stack). Another
   --  version of this procedure had code to reverse the chain, so as to
   --  activate the tasks in the order of declaration. This might be nice, but
   --  it is not needed if priority-based scheduling is supported, since all
   --  the activated tasks synchronize on the activators lock before they
   --  start activating and so they should start activating in priority order.
   --  ??? Actually, the body of this package DOES reverse the chain, so I
   --  don't understand the above comment.

   --  wake it up so it can check to see if all tasks have been activated.

   --  T.Activator should only be null iff T has completed activation.

   procedure Complete_Master;

   --  be called on exit from any master where Enter_Master was called.
   --  Assume abort is deferred at this point.

   procedure Complete_Task;

   --  This should be called from an implicit at-end handler
   --  associated with the task body, when it completes.
   --  From this point, the current task will become not callable.
   --  If the current task have not completed activation, this should be done
   --  now in order to wake up the activator (the environment task).

      Created_Task         : out Task_Id);
   --  Compiler interface only. Do not call from within the RTS.
   --  This must be called to create a new task.
   --
   --  Priority is the task's priority (assumed to be in range of type
   --   System.Any_Priority)
   --
   --  Stack_Size is the stack size of the task to create
   --
   --  Secondary_Stack_Size is the size of the secondary stack to be used by
   --  the task.
   --
   --  Task_Info is the task info associated with the created task, or
   --   Unspecified_Task_Info if none.
   --
   --  CPU is the task affinity. Passed as an Integer because the undefined
   --   value is not in the range of CPU_Range. Static range checks are
   --   performed when analyzing the pragma, and dynamic ones are performed
   --   before setting the affinity at run time.
   --
   --  Relative_Deadline is the relative deadline associated with the created
   --   task by means of a pragma Relative_Deadline, or 0.0 if none.
   --
   --  Domain is the dispatching domain associated with the created task by
   --   means of a Dispatching_Domain pragma or aspect, or null if none.
   --
   --  State is the compiler generated task's procedure body
   --
   --  Discriminants is a pointer to a limited record whose discriminants
   --   are those of the task to create. This parameter should be passed as
   --   the single argument to State.
   --
   --  Elaborated is a pointer to a Boolean that must be set to true on exit
   --   if the task could be successfully elaborated.
   --
   --  Chain is a linked list of task that needs to be created. On exit,
   --   Created_Task.Activation_Link will be Chain.T_ID, and Chain.T_ID
   --   will be Created_Task (e.g the created task will be linked at the front
   --   of Chain).
   --
   --  Task_Image is a string created by the compiler that the
   --   run time can store to ease the debugging and the
   --   Ada.Task_Identification facility.
   --
   --  Created_Task is the resulting task.
   --
   --  This procedure can raise Storage_Error if the task creation failed.

   function Current_Master return Master_Level;
   --  Compiler interface only.
   --  This is called to obtain the current master nesting level.

   procedure Enter_Master;
   --  Compiler interface only.  Do not call from within the RTS.
   --  This must be called on entry to any "master" where a task,
   --  or access type designating objects containing tasks, may be
   --  declared.

   procedure Expunge_Unactivated_Tasks (Chain : in out Activation_Chain);
   --  Compiler interface only. Do not call from within the RTS.
   --  This must be called by the compiler-generated code for an allocator if
   --  the allocated object contains tasks, if the allocator exits without
   --  calling Activate_Tasks for a given activation chains, as can happen if
   --  an exception occurs during initialization of the object.
   --
   --  This should be called ONLY for tasks created via an allocator. Recovery
   --  of storage for unactivated local task declarations is done by
   --  Complete_Master and Complete_Task.
   --
   --  We remove each task from Chain and All_Tasks_List before we free the
   --  storage of its ATCB.
   --
   --  In other places where we recover the storage of unactivated tasks, we
   --  need to clean out the entry queues, but here that should not be
   --  necessary, since these tasks should not have been visible to any other
   --  tasks, and so no task should be able to queue a call on their entries.
   --
   --  Just in case somebody misuses this subprogram, there is a check to
   --  verify this condition.

   procedure Finalize_Global_Tasks;
   --  This should be called to complete the execution of the environment task
   --  and shut down the tasking runtime system. It is the equivalent of
   --  Complete_Task, but for the environment task.
   --
   --  The environment task must first call Complete_Master, to wait for user
   --  tasks that depend on library-level packages to terminate. It then calls
   --  Abort_Dependents to abort the "independent" library-level server tasks
   --  that are created implicitly by the RTS packages (signal and timer server
   --  tasks), and then waits for them to terminate. Then, it calls
   --  Vulnerable_Complete_Task.
   --
   --  It currently also executes the global finalization list, and then resets
   --  the "soft links".

   procedure Free_Task (T : Task_Id);
   --  Recover all runtime system storage associated with the task T, but only
   --  if T has terminated. Do nothing in the other case. It is called from
   --  Unchecked_Deallocation, for objects that are or contain tasks.

   procedure Move_Activation_Chain
     (From, To   : Activation_Chain_Access;
      New_Master : Master_ID);
   --  Compiler interface only. Do not call from within the RTS.
   --  Move all tasks on From list to To list, and change their Master_Of_Task
   --  to be New_Master. This is used to implement build-in-place function
   --  returns. Tasks that are part of the return object are initially placed
   --  on an activation chain local to the return statement, and their master
   --  is the return statement, in case the return statement is left
   --  prematurely (due to raising an exception, being aborted, or a goto or
   --  exit statement). Once the return statement has completed successfully,
   --  Move_Activation_Chain is called to move them to the caller's activation
   --  chain, and change their master to the one passed in by the caller. If
   --  that doesn't happen, they will never be activated, and will become
   --  terminated on leaving the return statement.

   function Terminated (T : Task_Id) return Boolean;
   --  This is called by the compiler to implement the 'Terminated attribute.
   --  Though is not required to be so by the ARM, we choose to synchronize
   --  with the task's ATCB, so that this is more useful for polling the state
   --  of a task, and so that it becomes an abort completion point for the
   --  calling task (via Undefer_Abort).
   --
   --  source code:
   --     T1'Terminated
   --
   --  code expansion:
   --     terminated (t1._task_id)

   procedure Terminate_Task (Self_ID : Task_Id);
   --  Terminate the calling task.
   --  This should only be called by the Task_Wrapper procedure, and to
   --  deallocate storage associate with foreign tasks.

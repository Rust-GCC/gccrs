! There are four combinations of repeatable and image_distinct.  The
! language below is from the F2018 standard (actually, J3/18-007r1).
!
! This routine is only used for non-coarray programs or with programs
! compiled with -fcoarray=single.  Use of -fcoarray=lib or -fcoarray=shared
! requires different routines due to the need for communication between
! images under case(iv).
!
! Technically, neither image_distinct nor image_num are now needed.  The
! interface to _gfortran_random_init() is maintained for libgfortran ABI.
! Note, the Fortran standard requires the image_distinct argument, so
! it will always have a valid value, and the frontend generates an value
! of 0 for image_num.

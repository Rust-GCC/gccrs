/* PACK is specified as follows:

   13.14.80 PACK (ARRAY, MASK, [VECTOR])

   Description: Pack an array into an array of rank one under the
   control of a mask.

   Class: Transformational function.

   Arguments:
      ARRAY   may be of any type. It shall not be scalar.
      MASK    shall be of type LOGICAL. It shall be conformable with ARRAY.
      VECTOR  (optional) shall be of the same type and type parameters
              as ARRAY. VECTOR shall have at least as many elements as
              there are true elements in MASK. If MASK is a scalar
              with the value true, VECTOR shall have at least as many
              elements as there are in ARRAY.

   Result Characteristics: The result is an array of rank one with the
   same type and type parameters as ARRAY. If VECTOR is present, the
   result size is that of VECTOR; otherwise, the result size is the
   number /t/ of true elements in MASK unless MASK is scalar with the
   value true, in which case the result size is the size of ARRAY.

   Result Value: Element /i/ of the result is the element of ARRAY
   that corresponds to the /i/th true element of MASK, taking elements
   in array element order, for /i/ = 1, 2, ..., /t/. If VECTOR is
   present and has size /n/ > /t/, element /i/ of the result has the
   value VECTOR(/i/), for /i/ = /t/ + 1, ..., /n/.

   Examples: The nonzero elements of an array M with the value
   | 0 0 0 |
   | 9 0 0 | may be "gathered" by the function PACK. The result of
   | 0 0 7 |
   PACK (M, MASK = M.NE.0) is [9,7] and the result of PACK (M, M.NE.0,
   VECTOR = (/ 2,4,6,8,10,12 /)) is [9,7,6,8,10,12].

There are two variants of the PACK intrinsic: one, where MASK is
array valued, and the other one where MASK is scalar.  */

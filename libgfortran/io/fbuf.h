/* Formatting buffer. This is a temporary scratch buffer used by
   formatted read and writes.  After every formatted I/O statement,
   this buffer is flushed. This buffer is needed since not all devices
   are seekable, and T or TL edit descriptors require moving backwards
   in the record.  However, advance='no' complicates the situation, so
   the buffer must only be partially flushed from the end of the last
   flush until the current position in the record. */

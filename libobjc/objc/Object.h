/* The Object class is a very minimal root class included with the
   runtime.  It is used as superclass for the two classes included
   with the runtime, Protocol and NXConstantString.

   Because Objective-C allows multiple root classes, you can define
   your own root class, different from Object.

   In particular, a Foundation library (such as GNUstep Base) is
   expected to provide its own root class (typically called NSObject),
   fully integrated with the library's own high-level features.  It is
   expected that you should always use and interact with NSObject, and
   mostly ignore Object.  */

This is the runtime support library for the Go programming language.
This library is intended for use with gccgo, the Go frontend for GCC.
For more information on Go please see http://golang.org/ .

The library has only been tested on GNU/Linux using glibc.  It should
not be difficult to port to other operating systems.

The library has only been tested on x86/x86_64 systems.  It should not
be difficult to port to other architectures.

Directories:

go
  A copy of the Go library from http://golang.org/ , with a few
  changes for gccgo.  Notably, the reflection interface is different.

runtime
  Runtime functions, written in C, which are called directly by the
  compiler or by the library.

syscalls
  System call support.

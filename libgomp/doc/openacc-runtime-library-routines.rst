OpenACC Runtime Library Routines
--------------------------------

The runtime routines described here are defined by section 3 of the OpenACC
specifications in version 2.6.
They have C linkage, and do not throw exceptions.
Generally, they are available only for the host, with the exception of
``acc_on_device``, which is available for both the host and the
acceleration device.

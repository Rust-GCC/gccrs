/* This is an NVPTX specific implementation of a mutex synchronization
   mechanism for libgomp.  This type is private to the library.  This
   implementation uses atomic instructions and busy waiting.

   A ptrlock has four states:
   0/NULL Initial
   1      Owned by me, I get to write a pointer to ptrlock.
   2      Some thread is waiting on the ptrlock.
   >2     Ptrlock contains a valid pointer.
   It is not valid to gain the ptrlock and then write a NULL to it.  */

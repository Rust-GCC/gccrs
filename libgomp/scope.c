/* This routine is called when first encountering a scope construct
   with task reductions.  While scope is not a work-sharing construct,
   if it has task reductions on it, we treat it as one, but as if it is
   nowait, so the work-sharing behavior is done solely to choose which
   thread does the initial initialization of task reductions and which
   threads follow.  scope with task reductions must not be nowait,
   but the barrier and GOMP_workshare_task_reduction_unregister are emitted
   by the lowered code later.  */

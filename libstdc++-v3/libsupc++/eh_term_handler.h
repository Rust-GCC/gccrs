/* We default to the talkative, informative handler in a normal hosted
   library.  This pulls in the demangler, the dyn-string utilities, and
   elements of the I/O library.  For a low-memory environment, you can return
   to the earlier "silent death" handler by configuring GCC with
   --disable-libstdcxx-verbose and rebuilding the library.
   In a freestanding environment, we default to this latter approach.  */

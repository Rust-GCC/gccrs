// Actually we wouldn't need this header at all, but because of PR 53579
// libstdc++'s configury will not pickup the -matomic-model= option when
// set in the environment.  This makes it impossible to enable the proper
// atomic model on SH without modifying GCC itself, because libstdc++ always
// thinks the target doesn't do any atomics and uses the default mutex based
// implementation from cpu/generic/atomicity_mutex.

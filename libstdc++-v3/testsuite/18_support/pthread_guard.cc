// This used to deadlock with the old libstdc++ because there is only one
// global mutex guarding initialization of statics and it is held during by
// the initializer thread of a static until the variable is completely
// initialized. If the initializer thread creates and waits for another thread
// which also initializes a static variable, there will be a deadlock because
// the first thread is holding the mutex and waiting for the second thread,
// which is blocked when it is acquiring the mutex.

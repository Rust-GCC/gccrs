  // be overwritten when copying from other instances that haven't
  // been fully initialized: this data type is compatible with C, so

  // operator= could be implemented as a full-object memcpy, including
  // padding bits, rather than fieldwise copying.  However, since
  // we're comparing two values copied from the same state_type
  // instance, if padding bits are copied, we'll get the same for both
  // of them, and if they aren't, we'll keep the values we initialized

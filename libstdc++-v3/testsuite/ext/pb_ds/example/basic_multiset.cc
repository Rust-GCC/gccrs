// This example shows how to use "multisets".

// In this example we build a very simple priority queue that also can
// be queried if an entry contains (i.e., it is slightly similar to an
// associative container as well as a priority queue). The priority
// queue adapts a "multiset".

// (Note that there are more efficient ways for implementing this than
// by adapting an associative container. This is just an example for
// "multisets".)

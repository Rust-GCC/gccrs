 * @file priority_queue_dijkstra_example.cpp
 * A basic example showing how to cross reference a vector and a
 * priority-queue for modify.
 */

/**
 * This example shows how to cross-reference priority queues
 * and a vector. I.e., using a vector to
 * map keys to entries in a priority queue, and using the priority
 * queue to map entries to the vector. The combination
 * can be used for fast modification of keys.
 *
 * As an example, a very simple form of Diskstra's algorithm is used. The graph
 * is represented by an adjacency matrix. Nodes and vertices are size_ts, and
 * it is assumed that the minimal path between any two nodes is less than 1000.

 * @file store_hash_example.cpp
 * An example showing how to store hash-values with

 */

/**
 * This example shows how to configure a hash-based container to store
 * the hash value of each key along with each entry. This technique
 * is useful for complex keys (e.g., strings in this example), since
 * it lowers the cost of collisions. For simpler types (e.g., integers),
 * where the cost of comparing keys is of the same order as the cost
 * of comparing hash values, this technique adds unnecessary overhead.

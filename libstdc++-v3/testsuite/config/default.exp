# This file is loaded only if a target-specific file or OS-specific file
# is not found first.  It should provide libstdc++_load, which runs a
# program.  (The default calls the standard remote_load.)  It may also
# provide libstdc++_compile, but this is not presently used.  It must
# provide libstdc++_target_compile, which does the same thing and is used.

# Here are the default definitions:
load_lib "standard.exp"

# target-supports.exp uses this
proc ${tool}_target_compile { srcfile destfile compile_type options } {
    v3_target_compile $srcfile $destfile $compile_type $options
}

# Support for old dejagnu.  Must be loaded here, not in libstdc++.exp, to
# make sure all existing procs are loaded when their presence is tested.

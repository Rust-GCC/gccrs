# GCC Rust
![GCC Rust](logo.png?raw=true "GCC rust Logo")

Please note, the compiler is in a very early stage and not usable yet for compiling real Rust programs.

gccrs is a full alternative implementation of the Rust language ontop of GCC with the goal
to become fully upstream with the GNU toolchain.

The origin of this project was a community effort several years ago where Rust was still at version 0.9;
the language was subject to so much change that it became difficult for a community effort to play catch up.
Now that the language is stable, it is an excellent time to create alternative compilers. The developers of
the project are keen “Rustaceans” with a desire to give back to the Rust community and to learn what GCC is capable
of when it comes to a modern language.

## FAQ

Please find the answers to frequently asked questions over on: https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions

## Development Environment

### Building

Fetch dependencies for Ubuntu:

```bash
$ apt install build-essential libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev flex bison autogen gcc-multilib dejagnu
```

Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Rust-GCC/gccrs.git
```

It is important to remember that GNU toolchain projects are designed to be built outside of their source directory
which is why a build directory is created.

```bash
$ mkdir gccrs-build
$ cd gccrs-build
$ ../gccrs/configure --prefix=$HOME/gccrs-install --disable-bootstrap --enable-multilib --enable-languages=rust
$ make
```

Running the compiler itself without make install we can simply invoke the compiler proper:

```bash
$ ./gcc/rust1 test.rs -frust-dump-parse -Warray-bounds -dumpbase test.rs -mtune=generic -march=x86-64 -O0 -version -fdump-tree-gimple -o test.s -L/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -L/lib/../lib64 -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -L/usr/lib/../lib64
```

To invoke the compiler driver (gccrs) we need to:

```bash
$ make install
```

Then invoke the compiler from the installation directory:

```bash
$ $HOME/gccrs-install/gccrs -g -O2 -c test.rs -o test.o
$ $HOME/gccrs-install/gccrs -o test test.o
```

You can also setup your shell to automatically find the installed compiler. For example for `bash`, add the following in your `$HOME/.bashrc`:

```bash
export PATH=$HOME/gccrs-install/bin:$PATH

```

## Testsuite

Invoke the full testsuite from the build directory (`gcc/gccrs-build` in the previous commands):

```bash
$ make check-rust
```

Invoke a subset of the testsuite. For example, to only execute the tests that are expected to fail:

```bash
$ make check-rust  RUNTESTFLAGS="xfail_compile.exp"
```
The project currently has 3 sets of tests:
- `execute.exp` : execution tests
- `compile.exp` : compilation only tests, using combination of options
- `xfail_compile.exp` : compilation only tests expected to fail

Invoke only a specific test :

```bash
$ make check-rust  RUNTESTFLAGS="xfail_compile.exp=continue1.rs"
```

Logs (with corresponding commands) can be found in : `gccrs-build/gcc/testsuite/rust/rust.log`.

See [GCC Testing documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html) for more details.

Test cases are located within [gcc/testsuite/rust.test](gcc/testsuite/rust.test) please feel free to contribute your specific
test cases referencing any issues on Github.

## Debugging

### Enabling internal checks

GCC has several internal checks that can be enabled during configuration. In the case of `gccrs`, you can enable the following:
```bash
$ ../gccrs/configure --prefix=$HOME/gccrs-install --disable-bootstrap --enable-multilib --enable-languages=rust --enable-checking=gimple,tree,types
```

### GDB
You can directly invoke `gdb` on the `rust1` compiler process (you can find the
exact command adding `--verbose` to your `gccrs` invocation):
```bash
$ gccrs test.rs -O0 -S -o arithmetic_expressions1.s --verbose
...
 /some/path/../../rust1 test.rs -quiet -dumpbase arithmetic_expressions1.rs -dumpbase-ext .rs
 -mtune=generic -march=x86-64 -O0 -w -version -fdiagnostics-color=never -fno-diagnostics-show-caret -fno-diagnostics-show-line-numbers -fdiagnostics-urls=never -fdiagnostics-path-format=separate-events -o test.s -L/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -L/lib/../lib64 -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
...
$ gdb --args  /some/path/../../rust1 test.rs -quiet -dumpbase arithmetic_expressions1.rs -dumpbase-ext .rs
 -mtune=generic -march=x86-64 -O0 -w -version -fdiagnostics-color=never -fno-diagnostics-show-caret -fno-diagnostics-show-line-numbers -fdiagnostics-urls=never -fdiagnostics-path-format=separate-events -o test.s -L/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -L/lib/../lib64 -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
```

Or simply add the `-wrapper gdb,--args` option. This will call each subcommand in `gdb` and you simply have to break/debug in `rust1`:
```bash
$ gccrs test.rs -O0 -S -o arithmetic_expressions1.s -wrapper gdb,--args
```

## Docker image

There is a docker image hosted over on: 

https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/philberty/gccrs

```bash
$ docker pull philberty/gccrs
```

Or you can build your own image:

```bash
$ docker build . -t gccrs-dev
```
If you want to build an object file: 

```bash
$ docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp \
    gccrs-dev:latest gccrs -g -O2 -c \
    gcc/testsuite/rust.test/compilable/type_infer1.rs -o type_infer1.o
```

If you want to build an executable file:
```bash
$ docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp \
    gccrs-dev:latest gccrs -g -O2 \
    gcc/testsuite/rust.test/compilable/type_infer1.rs -o type_infer1
```

To emit assembly :
```bash
$ docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp \
    gccrs-dev:latest gccrs -g -O2 \
    gcc/testsuite/rust.test/compilable/type_infer1.rs -S -o type_infer1.s 
```

To emit the debug outputs you can add the option -frust-dump-all :
```bash
$ docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp \
    gccrs-dev:latest gccrs -g -O2 \
    gcc/testsuite/rust.test/compilable/type_infer1.rs -o type_infer1 -frust-dump-all
```


## Contributing

Please be aware this project is designed to be pushed upstream to GCC when we reach some milestones, and this means we require
contributions to have copyright assignment in place. Please see https://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html.

Not all contributions must be code; we would love to see new test cases or bugs and issues to be reported. Feel free to add any comments on open PRs

## Community

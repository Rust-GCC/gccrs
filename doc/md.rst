.. _simple-constraints:

Simple Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are
the letters that are allowed:

whitespace
  Whitespace characters are ignored and can be inserted at any position
  except the first.  This enables each alternative for different operands to
  be visually aligned in the machine description even if they have different
  number of constraints and modifiers.

  .. index:: m in constraint, memory references in constraints

m
  A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the machine
  supports in general.
  Note that the letter used for the general memory constraint can be
  re-defined by a back end using the ``TARGET_MEM_CONSTRAINT`` macro.

  .. index:: offsettable address, o in constraint

o
  A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
  :dfn:`offsettable`.  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
  the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine mode)
  may be added to the address and the result is also a valid memory
  address.

  .. index:: autoincrement/decrement addressing

  For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
  address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
  slightly larger constant is also within the range of address-offsets
  supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or autodecrement
  address is not offsettable.  More complicated indirect/indexed
  addresses may or may not be offsettable depending on the other
  addressing modes that the machine supports.

  Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
  operand, the constraint letter :samp:`o` is valid only when accompanied
  by both :samp:`<` (if the target machine has predecrement addressing)
  and :samp:`>` (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).

  .. index:: V in constraint

V
  A memory operand that is not offsettable.  In other words, anything that
  would fit the :samp:`m` constraint but not the :samp:`o` constraint.

  .. index:: < in constraint

<
  A memory operand with autodecrement addressing (either predecrement or
  postdecrement) is allowed.  In inline ``asm`` this constraint is only
  allowed if the operand is used exactly once in an instruction that can
  handle the side effects.  Not using an operand with :samp:`<` in constraint
  string in the inline ``asm`` pattern at all or using it in multiple
  instructions isn't valid, because the side effects wouldn't be performed
  or would be performed more than once.  Furthermore, on some targets
  the operand with :samp:`<` in constraint string must be accompanied by
  special instruction suffixes like ``%U0`` instruction suffix on PowerPC
  or ``%P0`` on IA-64.

  .. index:: > in constraint

>
  A memory operand with autoincrement addressing (either preincrement or
  postincrement) is allowed.  In inline ``asm`` the same restrictions
  as for :samp:`<` apply.

  .. index:: r in constraint, registers in constraints

r
  A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general
  register.

  .. index:: constants in constraints, i in constraint

i
  An immediate integer operand (one with constant value) is allowed.
  This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at
  assembly time or later.

  .. index:: n in constraint

n
  An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed.
  Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands less
  than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use :samp:`n`
  rather than :samp:`i`.

  .. index:: I in constraint

:samp:`{I}, {J}, {K}, ... {P}`
  Other letters in the range :samp:`I` through :samp:`P` may be defined in
  a machine-dependent fashion to permit immediate integer operands with
  explicit integer values in specified ranges.  For example, on the
  68000, :samp:`I` is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8.
  This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
  instructions.

  .. index:: E in constraint

E
  An immediate floating operand (expression code ``const_double``) is
  allowed, but only if the target floating point format is the same as
  that of the host machine (on which the compiler is running).

  .. index:: F in constraint

F
  An immediate floating operand (expression code ``const_double`` or
  ``const_vector``) is allowed.

  .. index:: G in constraint, H in constraint

:samp:`{G}, {H}`
  :samp:`G` and :samp:`H` may be defined in a machine-dependent fashion to
  permit immediate floating operands in particular ranges of values.

  .. index:: s in constraint

s
  An immediate integer operand whose value is not an explicit integer is
  allowed.

  This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand with a
  value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow any known
  value.  So why use :samp:`s` instead of :samp:`i`?  Sometimes it allows
  better code to be generated.

  For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible to
  use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between -128
  and 127, better code results from loading the value into a register and
  using the register.  This is because the load into the register can be
  done with a :samp:`moveq` instruction.  We arrange for this to happen
  by defining the letter :samp:`K` to mean 'any integer outside the
  range -128 to 127', and then specifying :samp:`Ks` in the operand
  constraints.

  .. index:: g in constraint

g
  Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed, except for
  registers that are not general registers.

  .. index:: X in constraint

X

  .. only:: gccint

    Any operand whatsoever is allowed, even if it does not satisfy
    ``general_operand``.  This is normally used in the constraint of
    a ``match_scratch`` when certain alternatives will not actually
    require a scratch register.

  .. only:: not gccint

    Any operand whatsoever is allowed.

  .. index:: 0 in constraint, digits in constraint

:samp:`{0}, {1}, {2}, ... {9}`
  An operand that matches the specified operand number is allowed.  If a
  digit is used together with letters within the same alternative, the
  digit should come last.

  This number is allowed to be more than a single digit.  If multiple
  digits are encountered consecutively, they are interpreted as a single
  decimal integer.  There is scant chance for ambiguity, since to-date
  it has never been desirable that :samp:`10` be interpreted as matching
  either operand 1 *or* operand 0.  Should this be desired, one
  can use multiple alternatives instead.

  .. index:: matching constraint, constraint, matching

  This is called a :dfn:`matching constraint` and what it really means is
  that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles

  .. only:: gccint

    considered separate in the RTL insn.  For example, an add insn has two
    input operands and one output operand in the RTL, but on most CISC

  .. only:: not gccint

    which ``asm`` distinguishes.  For example, an add instruction uses
    two input operands and an output operand, but on most CISC

  machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one of them an
  input-output operand:

  .. code-block::

    addl #35,r12

  Matching constraints are used in these circumstances.
  More precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
  operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
  smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
  constraint.

  .. only:: gccint

    For operands to match in a particular case usually means that they
    are identical-looking RTL expressions.  But in a few special cases
    specific kinds of dissimilarity are allowed.  For example, ``*x``
    as an input operand will match ``*x++`` as an output operand.
    For proper results in such cases, the output template should always
    use the output-operand's number when printing the operand.

  .. index:: load address instruction, push address instruction, address constraints, p in constraint

p
  An operand that is a valid memory address is allowed.  This is
  for 'load address' and 'push address' instructions.

  .. index:: address_operand

  :samp:`p` in the constraint must be accompanied by ``address_operand``
  as the predicate in the ``match_operand``.  This predicate interprets
  the mode specified in the ``match_operand`` as the mode of the memory
  reference for which the address would be valid.

  .. index:: other register constraints, extensible constraints

other-letters
  Other letters can be defined in machine-dependent fashion to stand for
  particular classes of registers or other arbitrary operand types.
  :samp:`d`, :samp:`a` and :samp:`f` are defined on the 68000/68020 to stand
  for data, address and floating point registers.

.. only:: gccint

  In order to have valid assembler code, each operand must satisfy
  its constraint.  But a failure to do so does not prevent the pattern
  from applying to an insn.  Instead, it directs the compiler to modify
  the code so that the constraint will be satisfied.  Usually this is
  done by copying an operand into a register.

  Contrast, therefore, the two instruction patterns that follow:

  .. code-block:: c++

    (define_insn ""
      [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
            (plus:SI (match_dup 0)
                     (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r")))]
      ""
      "...")

  which has two operands, one of which must appear in two places, and

  .. code-block:: c++

    (define_insn ""
      [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r")
            (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "r")))]
      ""
      "...")

  which has three operands, two of which are required by a constraint to be
  identical.  If we are considering an insn of the form

  .. code-block:: c++

    (insn n prev next
      (set (reg:SI 3)
           (plus:SI (reg:SI 6) (reg:SI 109)))
      ...)

  the first pattern would not apply at all, because this insn does not
  contain two identical subexpressions in the right place.  The pattern would
  say, 'That does not look like an add instruction; try other patterns'.
  The second pattern would say, 'Yes, that's an add instruction, but there
  is something wrong with it'.  It would direct the reload pass of the
  compiler to generate additional insns to make the constraint true.  The
  results might look like this:

  .. code-block:: c++

    (insn n2 prev n
      (set (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 6))
      ...)

    (insn n n2 next
      (set (reg:SI 3)
           (plus:SI (reg:SI 3) (reg:SI 109)))
      ...)

  It is up to you to make sure that each operand, in each pattern, has
  constraints that can handle any RTL expression that could be present for
  that operand.  (When multiple alternatives are in use, each pattern must,
  for each possible combination of operand expressions, have at least one
  alternative which can handle that combination of operands.)  The
  constraints don't need to *allow* any possible operand---when this is
  the case, they do not constrain---but they must at least point the way to
  reloading any possible operand so that it will fit.

  * If the constraint accepts whatever operands the predicate permits,
    there is no problem: reloading is never necessary for this operand.

    For example, an operand whose constraints permit everything except
    registers is safe provided its predicate rejects registers.

    An operand whose predicate accepts only constant values is safe
    provided its constraints include the letter :samp:`i`.  If any possible
    constant value is accepted, then nothing less than :samp:`i` will do;
    if the predicate is more selective, then the constraints may also be
    more selective.

  * Any operand expression can be reloaded by copying it into a register.
    So if an operand's constraints allow some kind of register, it is
    certain to be safe.  It need not permit all classes of registers; the
    compiler knows how to copy a register into another register of the
    proper class in order to make an instruction valid.

    .. index:: nonoffsettable memory reference, memory reference, nonoffsettable

  * A nonoffsettable memory reference can be reloaded by copying the
    address into a register.  So if the constraint uses the letter
    :samp:`o`, all memory references are taken care of.

  * A constant operand can be reloaded by allocating space in memory to
    hold it as preinitialized data.  Then the memory reference can be used
    in place of the constant.  So if the constraint uses the letters
    :samp:`o` or :samp:`m`, constant operands are not a problem.

  * If the constraint permits a constant and a pseudo register used in an insn
    was not allocated to a hard register and is equivalent to a constant,
    the register will be replaced with the constant.  If the predicate does
    not permit a constant and the insn is re-recognized for some reason, the
    compiler will crash.  Thus the predicate must always recognize any
    objects allowed by the constraint.

  If the operand's predicate can recognize registers, but the constraint does
  not permit them, it can make the compiler crash.  When this operand happens
  to be a register, the reload pass will be stymied, because it does not know
  how to copy a register temporarily into memory.

  If the predicate accepts a unary operator, the constraint applies to the
  operand.  For example, the MIPS processor at ISA level 3 supports an
  instruction which adds two registers in ``SImode`` to produce a
  ``DImode`` result, but only if the registers are correctly sign
  extended.  This predicate for the input operands accepts a
  ``sign_extend`` of an ``SImode`` register.  Write the constraint
  to indicate the type of register that is required for the operand of the
  ``sign_extend``.

.. only:: not gccint

  So the first alternative for the 68000's logical-or could be written as
  ``"+m" (output) : "ir" (input)``.  The second could be ``"+r"
  (output): "irm" (input)``.  However, the fact that two memory locations
  cannot be used in a single instruction prevents simply using ``"+rm"
  (output) : "irm" (input)``.  Using multi-alternatives, this might be
  written as ``"+m,r" (output) : "ir,irm" (input)``.  This describes
  all the available alternatives to the compiler, allowing it to choose
  the most efficient one for the current conditions.

  There is no way within the template to determine which alternative was
  chosen.  However you may be able to wrap your ``asm`` statements with
  builtins such as ``__builtin_constant_p`` to achieve the desired results.

.. index:: multiple alternative constraints

.. _multi-alternative:

Multiple Alternative Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of possible
operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction can combine
register or an immediate value into memory, or it can combine any kind of
operand into a register; but it cannot combine one memory location into
another.

These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An alternative
can be described by a series of letters for each operand.  The overall
constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this operand
from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this operand from
the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last alternative.
All operands for a single instruction must have the same number of
alternatives.

.. only:: gccint

  Here is how it is done for fullword logical-or on the 68000:

  .. code-block:: c++

    (define_insn "iorsi3"
      [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=m,d")
            (ior:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
                    (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dKs,dmKs")))]
      ...)

  The first alternative has :samp:`m` (memory) for operand 0, :samp:`0` for
  operand 1 (meaning it must match operand 0), and :samp:`dKs` for operand
  2.  The second alternative has :samp:`d` (data register) for operand 0,
  :samp:`0` for operand 1, and :samp:`dmKs` for operand 2.  The :samp:`=` and
  :samp:`%` in the constraints apply to all the alternatives; their
  meaning is explained in the next section (see :ref:`class-preferences`).

  If all the operands fit any one alternative, the instruction is valid.
  Otherwise, for each alternative, the compiler counts how many instructions
  must be added to copy the operands so that that alternative applies.
  The alternative requiring the least copying is chosen.  If two alternatives
  need the same amount of copying, the one that comes first is chosen.
  These choices can be altered with the :samp:`?` and :samp:`!` characters:

  .. index:: ? in constraint, question mark

  ``?``
    Disparage slightly the alternative that the :samp:`?` appears in,
    as a choice when no alternative applies exactly.  The compiler regards
    this alternative as one unit more costly for each :samp:`?` that appears
    in it.

    .. index:: ! in constraint, exclamation point

  ``!``
    Disparage severely the alternative that the :samp:`!` appears in.
    This alternative can still be used if it fits without reloading,
    but if reloading is needed, some other alternative will be used.

    .. index:: ^ in constraint, caret

  ``^``
    This constraint is analogous to :samp:`?` but it disparages slightly
    the alternative only if the operand with the :samp:`^` needs a reload.

    .. index:: $ in constraint, dollar sign

  ``$``
    This constraint is analogous to :samp:`!` but it disparages severely
    the alternative only if the operand with the :samp:`$` needs a reload.

  When an insn pattern has multiple alternatives in its constraints, often
  the appearance of the assembler code is determined mostly by which
  alternative was matched.  When this is so, the C code for writing the
  assembler code can use the variable ``which_alternative``, which is
  the ordinal number of the alternative that was actually satisfied (0 for
  the first, 1 for the second alternative, etc.).  See :ref:`output-statement`.

.. _class-preferences:

Register Class Preferences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. only:: gccint

  .. index:: class preference constraints, register class preference constraints, voting between constraint alternatives

  The operand constraints have another function: they enable the compiler
  to decide which kind of hardware register a pseudo register is best
  allocated to.  The compiler examines the constraints that apply to the
  insns that use the pseudo register, looking for the machine-dependent
  letters such as :samp:`d` and :samp:`a` that specify classes of registers.
  The pseudo register is put in whichever class gets the most 'votes'.
  The constraint letters :samp:`g` and :samp:`r` also vote: they vote in
  favor of a general register.  The machine description says which registers
  are considered general.

  Of course, on some machines all registers are equivalent, and no register
  classes are defined.  Then none of this complexity is relevant.

.. index:: modifiers in constraints, constraint modifier characters

.. _modifiers:

Constraint Modifier Characters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. prevent bad page break with this line

Here are constraint modifier characters.

.. index:: = in constraint

:samp:`=`
  Means that this operand is written to by this instruction:
  the previous value is discarded and replaced by new data.

  .. index:: + in constraint

:samp:`+`
  Means that this operand is both read and written by the instruction.

  When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
  it needs to know which operands are read by the instruction and
  which are written by it.  :samp:`=` identifies an operand which is only
  written; :samp:`+` identifies an operand that is both read and written; all
  other operands are assumed to only be read.

  If you specify :samp:`=` or :samp:`+` in a constraint, you put it in the
  first character of the constraint string.

  .. index:: & in constraint, earlyclobber operand

:samp:`&`
  Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an
  :dfn:`earlyclobber` operand, which is written before the instruction is
  finished using the input operands.  Therefore, this operand may not lie
  in a register that is read by the instruction or as part of any memory
  address.

  :samp:`&` applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
  constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
  requires :samp:`&` while others do not.  See, for example, the
  :samp:`movdf` insn of the 68000.

  An operand which is read by the instruction can be tied to an earlyclobber
  operand if its only use as an input occurs before the early result is
  written.  Adding alternatives of this form often allows GCC to produce
  better code when only some of the read operands can be affected by the
  earlyclobber. See, for example, the :samp:`mulsi3` insn of the ARM.

  Furthermore, if the :dfn:`earlyclobber` operand is also a read/write
  operand, then that operand is written only after it's used.

  :samp:`&` does not obviate the need to write :samp:`=` or :samp:`+`.  As
  :dfn:`earlyclobber` operands are always written, a read-only
  :dfn:`earlyclobber` operand is ill-formed and will be rejected by the
  compiler.

  .. index:: % in constraint

:samp:`%`
  Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the
  following operand.  This means that the compiler may interchange the
  two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands fit the
  constraints.  :samp:`%` applies to all alternatives and must appear as
  the first character in the constraint.  Only read-only operands can use
  :samp:`%`.

  .. only:: gccint

    This is often used in patterns for addition instructions
    that really have only two operands: the result must go in one of the
    arguments.  Here for example, is how the 68000 halfword-add
    instruction is defined:

    .. code-block:: c++

      (define_insn "addhi3"
        [(set (match_operand:HI 0 "general_operand" "=m,r")
           (plus:HI (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "%0,0")
                    (match_operand:HI 2 "general_operand" "di,g")))]
        ...)

  GCC can only handle one commutative pair in an asm; if you use more,
  the compiler may fail.  Note that you need not use the modifier if
  the two alternatives are strictly identical; this would only waste
  time in the reload pass.

  .. only:: gccint

    The modifier is not operational after
    register allocation, so the result of ``define_peephole2``
    and ``define_split`` s performed after reload cannot rely on
    :samp:`%` to make the intended insn match.

    .. index:: # in constraint

  :samp:`#`
    Says that all following characters, up to the next comma, are to be
    ignored as a constraint.  They are significant only for choosing
    register preferences.

    .. index:: * in constraint

  :samp:`*`
    Says that the following character should be ignored when choosing
    register preferences.  :samp:`*` has no effect on the meaning of the
    constraint as a constraint, and no effect on reloading.  For LRA
    :samp:`*` additionally disparages slightly the alternative if the
    following character matches the operand.

    Here is an example: the 68000 has an instruction to sign-extend a
    halfword in a data register, and can also sign-extend a value by
    copying it into an address register.  While either kind of register is
    acceptable, the constraints on an address-register destination are
    less strict, so it is best if register allocation makes an address
    register its goal.  Therefore, :samp:`*` is used so that the :samp:`d`
    constraint letter (for data register) is ignored when computing
    register preferences.

    .. code-block:: c++

      (define_insn "extendhisi2"
        [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=*d,a")
              (sign_extend:SI
               (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" "0,g")))]
        ...)

.. index:: machine specific constraints, constraints, machine specific

.. _machine-constraints:

Constraints for Particular Machines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Whenever possible, you should use the general-purpose constraint letters
in ``asm`` arguments, since they will convey meaning more readily to
people reading your code.  Failing that, use the constraint letters
that usually have very similar meanings across architectures.  The most
commonly used constraints are :samp:`m` and :samp:`r` (for memory and
general-purpose registers respectively; see :ref:`simple-constraints`), and
:samp:`I`, usually the letter indicating the most common
immediate-constant format.

Each architecture defines additional constraints.  These constraints
are used by the compiler itself for instruction generation, as well as
for ``asm`` statements; therefore, some of the constraints are not
particularly useful for ``asm``.  Here is a summary of some of the
machine-dependent constraints available on some particular machines;
it includes both constraints that are useful for ``asm`` and
constraints that aren't.  The compiler source file mentioned in the
table heading for each architecture is the definitive reference for
the meanings of that architecture's constraints.

PowerPC and IBM RS6000---:samp:`{config/rs6000/constraints.md}`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``r``
  A general purpose register (GPR), ``r0``... ``r31``.

``b``
  A base register.  Like ``r``, but ``r0`` is not allowed, so
  ``r1``... ``r31``.

``f``
  A floating point register (FPR), ``f0``... ``f31``.

``d``
  A floating point register.  This is the same as ``f`` nowadays;
  historically ``f`` was for single-precision and ``d`` was for
  double-precision floating point.

``v``
  An Altivec vector register (VR), ``v0``... ``v31``.

``wa``
  A VSX register (VSR), ``vs0``... ``vs63``.  This is either an
  FPR (``vs0``... ``vs31`` are ``f0``... ``f31``) or a VR
  (``vs32``... ``vs63`` are ``v0``... ``v31``).

  When using ``wa``, you should use the ``%x`` output modifier, so that
  the correct register number is printed.  For example:

  .. code-block:: c++

    asm ("xvadddp %x0,%x1,%x2"
         : "=wa" (v1)
         : "wa" (v2), "wa" (v3));

  You should not use ``%x`` for ``v`` operands:

  .. code-block:: c++

    asm ("xsaddqp %0,%1,%2"
         : "=v" (v1)
         : "v" (v2), "v" (v3));

  ``z``
    The carry bit, ``XER[CA]``.

  ``we``
    Like ``wa``, if :option:`-mpower9-vector` and :option:`-m64` are used;
    otherwise, ``NO_REGS``.

  ``wn``
    No register (``NO_REGS``).

  ``wr``
    Like ``r``, if :option:`-mpowerpc64` is used; otherwise, ``NO_REGS``.

  ``wx``
    Like ``d``, if :option:`-mpowerpc-gfxopt` is used; otherwise, ``NO_REGS``.

  ``wA``
    Like ``b``, if :option:`-mpowerpc64` is used; otherwise, ``NO_REGS``.

    A floating point constant that can be loaded into a register with one
    instruction per word.

  ``H``
    A floating point constant that can be loaded into a register using
    three instructions.

``m``
  A memory operand.
  Normally, ``m`` does not allow addresses that update the base register.
  If the ``<`` or ``>`` constraint is also used, they are allowed and
  therefore on PowerPC targets in that case it is only safe
  to use ``m<>`` in an ``asm`` statement if that ``asm`` statement
  accesses the operand exactly once.  The ``asm`` statement must also
  use ``%U<opno>`` as a placeholder for the 'update' flag in the
  corresponding load or store instruction.  For example:

  .. code-block:: c++

    asm ("st%U0 %1,%0" : "=m<>" (mem) : "r" (val));

  is correct but:

  .. code-block:: c++

    asm ("st %1,%0" : "=m<>" (mem) : "r" (val));

  is not.

.. only:: gccint

  ``es``
    A 'stable' memory operand; that is, one which does not include any
    automodification of the base register.  This used to be useful when
    ``m`` allowed automodification of the base register, but as those
    are now only allowed when ``<`` or ``>`` is used, ``es`` is
    basically the same as ``m`` without ``<`` and ``>``.

``Q``
  A memory operand addressed by just a base register.

.. only:: gccint

  ``Y``
    A memory operand for a DQ-form instruction.

``Z``
  A memory operand accessed with indexed or indirect addressing.

``c``
  The ``c`` register.

``d``
  The ``d`` register.

``S``
  The ``si`` register.

``D``
  The ``di`` register.

``A``
  The ``a`` and ``d`` registers.  This class is used for instructions
  that return double word results in the ``ax:dx`` register pair.  Single

  This is not correct on x86-64 as it would allocate tick in either ``ax``
  or ``dx``.  You have to use the following variant instead:

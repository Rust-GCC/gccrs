The GNU Project and GNU/Linux
=============================

The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like
operating system which is free software: the GNU system.  (GNU is a
recursive acronym for 'GNU's Not Unix'; it is pronounced
'guh-NEW'.)  Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the
kernel Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are often
referred to as 'Linux', they are more accurately called GNU/Linux
systems.

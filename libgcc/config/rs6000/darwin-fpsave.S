/* THE SAVE AND RESTORE ROUTINES CAN HAVE ONLY ONE GLOBALLY VISIBLE
   ENTRY POINT - callers have to jump to "saveFP+60" to save f29..f31,
   for example.  For FP reg saves/restores, it takes one instruction
   (4 bytes) to do the operation; for Vector regs, 2 instructions are
   required (8 bytes.)

   MORAL: DO NOT MESS AROUND WITH THESE FUNCTIONS!  */

/* Thread-local storage.

   A gthread TLS key is simply an offset in an array, the address of which
   we store in a single pointer field associated with the current task.

   On VxWorks 7, we have direct support for __thread variables and use
   such a variable as the pointer "field".  On other versions, we resort
   to __gthread_get_tls_data and __gthread_set_tls_data functions provided
   by the kernel.

   There is also a global array which records which keys are valid and
   which have destructors.

   A task delete hook is installed to execute key destructors.  The routines
   __gthread_enter_tls_dtor_context and __gthread_leave_tls_dtor_context,
   which are also provided by the kernel, ensure that it is safe to call
   free() on memory allocated by the task being deleted.  This is a no-op on
   VxWorks 5, but a major undertaking on AE.

   The task delete hook is only installed when at least one thread
   has TLS data.  This is a necessary precaution, to allow this module
   to be unloaded - a module with a hook can not be removed.

   Since this interface is used to allocate only a small number of
   keys, the table size is small and static, which simplifies the
   code quite a bit.  Revisit this if and when it becomes necessary.  */

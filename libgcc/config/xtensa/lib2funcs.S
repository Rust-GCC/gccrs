/* __xtensa_nonlocal_goto: This code does all the hard work of a
   nonlocal goto on Xtensa.  It is here in the library to avoid the
   code size bloat of generating it in-line.  There are two
   arguments:

	a2 = frame pointer for the procedure containing the label
	a3 = goto handler address

  This function never returns to its caller but instead goes directly
  to the address of the specified goto handler.  */

	/* Because the save area for a0-a3 is stored one frame below
	   the one identified by a2, the only way to restore those
	   registers is to unwind the stack.  If alloca() were never
	   called, we could just unwind until finding the sp value
	   matching a2.  However, a2 is a frame pointer, not a stack
	   pointer, and may not be encountered during the unwinding.
	   The solution is to unwind until going _past_ the value
	   given by a2.  This involves keeping three stack pointer
	   values during the unwinding:

		next = sp of frame N-1
		cur = sp of frame N
		prev = sp of frame N+1

	   When next > a2, the desired save area is stored relative
	   to prev.  At this point, cur will be the same as a2
	   except in the alloca() case.

	   Besides finding the values to be restored to a0-a3, we also
	   need to find the current window size for the target
	   function.  This can be extracted from the high bits of the
	   return address, initially in a0.  As the unwinding
	   proceeds, the window size is taken from the value of a0
	   saved _two_ frames below the current frame.  */

/* __xtensa_sync_caches: This function is called after writing a trampoline

   After the trampoline data is written out, it must be flushed out of
   the data cache into memory.  We use DHWB in case we have a writeback
   cache.  At least one DHWB instruction is needed for each data cache
   line which may be touched by the trampoline.  An ISYNC instruction
   must follow the DHWBs.

   We have to flush the i-cache to make sure that the new values get used.
   At least one IHI instruction is needed for each i-cache line which may
   be touched by the trampoline.  An ISYNC instruction is also needed to
   make sure that the modified instructions are loaded into the instruction
   fetch buffer.  */

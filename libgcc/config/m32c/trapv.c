/* See the comment by the definition of LIBGCC2_UNITS_PER_WORD in
   m32c.h for why we are creating extra versions of some of the
   functions defined in libgcc2.c.

   Note - this file is separate from lib2funcs.c so that the following
   functions will appear in the their object file.  This is necessary
   because they call abort() which is defined in the C library whereas
   the functions in lib2funcs.c are completely self sufficient.  */

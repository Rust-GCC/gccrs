/* The code in sections .init and .fini is supposed to be a single
   regular function.  The function in .init is called directly from

   crti.S contributes the prologue of a function to these sections,

   crti.o before any other object files that might add code to .init
   or .fini sections, and ENDFILE_SPEC should list crtn.o after any
   such object files.  */

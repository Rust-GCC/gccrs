/* Atomic built-in C functions for link compatibility with older code that
   was compiled to emit function calls for atomic built-ins.
   Notice that if no atomic model has been selected the functions in this
   file must not be generated, or else they will result in infinite no-op
   loops.
   Notice also, that all the generated functions below take three parameters,
   which is not actually true for some of the built-in functions.  However,
   on SH this does not matter, since the first four parameters are always
   passed in call clobbered registers.
   The return type for the sync_bool_compare_and_swap functions is also
   actually supposed to be a bool, but this also doesn't matter since any
   int return type <= 32 bit is returned in R0 on SH.  */

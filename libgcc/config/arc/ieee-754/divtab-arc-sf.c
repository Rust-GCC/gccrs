/* We use a polynom similar to a Tchebycheff polynom to get an initial
   seed, and then use a newton-raphson iteration step to get an
   approximate result
   If this result can't be rounded to the exact result with confidence, we
   round to the value between the two closest representable values, and
   test if the correctly rounded value is above or below this value.
 
   Because of the Newton-raphson iteration step, an error in the seed at X
   is amplified by X.  Therefore, we don't want a Tchebycheff polynom
   or a polynom that is close to optimal according to the maximum norm
   on the errro of the seed value; we want one that is close to optimal
   according to the maximum norm on the error of the result, i.e. we
   want the maxima of the polynom to increase linearily.
   Given an interval [X0,X2) over which to approximate,
   with X1 := (X0+X2)/2,  D := X1-X0, F := 1/D, and S := D/X1 we have,
   like for Tchebycheff polynoms:
   P(0) := 1
   but then we have:
   P(1) := X + S*D
   P(2) := 2 * X^2 + S*D * X - D^2
   Then again:
   P(n+1) := 2 * X * P(n) - D^2 * P (n-1)

/* This file is used by targets whose makefiles define SYNC
   to "yes".  It is compiled with SYNC_CFLAGS and provides
   out-of-line versions of all relevant __sync_* primitives.

   These routines are intended for targets like MIPS that have two
   ISA encodings (the "normal" ISA and the MIPS16 ISA).  The normal
   ISA provides full synchronization capabilities but the MIPS16 ISA
   has no encoding for them.  MIPS16 code must therefore call external
   non-MIPS16 implementations of the __sync_* routines.

   The file is compiled once for each routine.  The following __foo
   routines are selected by defining a macro called L<foo>:

       __sync_synchronize

   The following __foo_N routines are selected by defining FN=foo
   and SIZE=N:

       __sync_fetch_and_add_N
       __sync_fetch_and_sub_N
       __sync_fetch_and_or_N
       __sync_fetch_and_and_N
       __sync_fetch_and_xor_N
       __sync_fetch_and_nand_N
       __sync_add_and_fetch_N
       __sync_sub_and_fetch_N
       __sync_or_and_fetch_N
       __sync_and_and_fetch_N
       __sync_xor_and_fetch_N
       __sync_nand_and_fetch_N
       __sync_bool_compare_and_swap_N
       __sync_val_compare_and_swap_N
       __sync_lock_test_and_set_N

   SIZE can be 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16.  __foo_N is omitted if the target does
   not provide __sync_compare_and_swap_N.

   Note that __sync_lock_release does not fall back on external
   __sync_lock_release_N functions.  The default implementation
   of __sync_lock_release is a call to __sync_synchronize followed
   by a store of zero, so we don't need separate library functions
   for it.  */

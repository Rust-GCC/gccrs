@deftypefn Extension int filename_cmp (const char *@var{s1}, const char *@var{s2})

Return zero if the two file names @var{s1} and @var{s2} are equivalent.
If not equivalent, the returned value is similar to what @code{strcmp}
would return.  In other words, it returns a negative value if @var{s1}
is less than @var{s2}, or a positive value if @var{s2} is greater than
@var{s2}.

This function does not normalize file names.  As a result, this function
will treat filenames that are spelled differently as different even in
the case when the two filenames point to the same underlying file.
However, it does handle the fact that on DOS-like file systems, forward
and backward slashes are equal.

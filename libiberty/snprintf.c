@deftypefn Supplemental int snprintf (char *@var{buf}, size_t @var{n}, @
  const char *@var{format}, ...)

This function is similar to @code{sprintf}, but it will write to
@var{buf} at most @code{@var{n}-1} bytes of text, followed by a
terminating null byte, for a total of @var{n} bytes.
On error the return value is -1, otherwise it returns the number of
bytes, not including the terminating null byte, that would have been
written had @var{n} been sufficiently large, regardless of the actual
value of @var{n}.  Note some pre-C99 system libraries do not implement
this correctly so users cannot generally rely on the return value if
the system version of this function is used.
